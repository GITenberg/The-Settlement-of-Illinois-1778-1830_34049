<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the work here presented, an attempt has been made to
apply in the field of history, the study of types so long in
use in biological science. If the settlement of Illinois had been
an isolated historical fact, its narration would have been too
provincial to be seriously considered, but in many respects, the
history of this settlement is typical of that of other regions.
The Indian question, the land question, the transportation problem,
the problem of local government; these are a few of the
classes of questions wherein the experience of Illinois was not
unique.

This work was prepared while the writer was a student in the
University of Wisconsin. The first draft was critically and carefully
read by Prof. Frederick Jackson Turner, of that University,
and the second draft was read by Prof. John Bach McMaster,
of the University of Pennsylvania. In addition to suggestions
received from my teachers, valuable aid has been rendered by
Miss Caroline M. McIlvaine, the librarian of the Chicago Historical
Society, who placed at my disposal her wide knowledge
of the sources of Illinois history.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The omission of any reference in this work to the French
manuscripts, found by Clarence W. Alvord, is due to the fact
that at the time they were found, my work was so nearly completed
that it was loaned to Mr. Alvord to use in the preparation of
his article on the County of Illinois, while the press of professional
duties has been such that a subsequent use of the manuscripts
has been impracticable.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An Act for establishing the County of Illinois, and for
the more effectual protection and defence thereof,
passed both houses of the Virginia legislature on December
9, 1778.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
The new county was to include the inhabitants
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Virginia, north of the Ohio River, but its location
was not more definitely prescribed.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The words <span class="tei tei-q">“for the more effectual protection and defence
thereof”</span> in the title of the Act were thoroughly appropriate.
The Indians were in almost undisputed possession of
the land in Illinois, save the inconsiderable holdings of the
French. Some grants and sales of large tracts of land had
been made. In 1769, John Wilkins, British commandant
in Illinois, granted to the trading-firm of Baynton,
Wharton and Morgan, a great tract of land lying between
the Kaskaskia and the Mississippi rivers. The claim
to the land descended to John Edgar, who shared it with
John Murray St. Clair, son of Gov. Arthur St. Clair. The
claim was filed for 13,986 acres, but was found on survey
to contain 23,000 acres, and was confirmed by Gov. St. Clair.
At a later examination of titles, this claim was rejected
because the grant was made in the first instance counter
to the king's proclamation of 1763, and because the confirmation
by Gov. St. Clair was made after his authority
ceased and was not signed by the Secretary of the Northwest
Territory.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> In 1773, William Murray and others,
subsequently known as the Illinois Land Company, bought
two large tracts of land in Illinois from the Illinois Indians.
In 1775, a great tract lying on both sides of the Wabash
was similarly purchased by what later became the Wabash
Land Company. The purchase of the Illinois Company
was made in the presence, but without the sanction, of the
British officers, and Gen. Thomas Gage had the Indians
re-convened and the validity of the purchase expressly
denied. These large grants were illegal, and the Indians
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were not in consequence disposessed of them.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> Thus far,
the Indians of the region had been undisturbed by white
occupation. British landholders were few and the French
clearings were too small to affect the hunting-grounds.
French and British alike were interested in the fur trade.
A French town was more suited to be the center of an
Indian community than to become a point on its periphery,
for here the Indians came for religious instruction, provisions,
fire-arms, and fire-water. The Illinois Indian of
1778 had been degraded rather than elevated by his contact
with the whites. The observation made by an acute
French woman of large experience, although made at
another time and place, was applicable here. She said
that it was much easier for a Frenchman to learn to live
like an Indian than for an Indian to learn to live like a
Frenchman.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In point of numbers and of occupied territory, the French
population was trifling in comparison with the Indian. In
1766-67, the white inhabitants of the region were estimated
at about two thousand.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>
Some five years later,<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> Kaskaskia
was reported as having about five hundred white
and between four and five hundred black inhabitants;
Prairie du Rocher, one hundred whites and eighty negroes;
Fort Chartres, a very few inhabitants; St. Philips, two or
three families; and Cahokia, three hundred whites and
eighty negroes. At the same time, there was a village of
the Kaskaskia tribe with about two hundred and ten persons,
including sixty warriors, three miles north of Kaskaskia,
and a village of one hundred and seventy warriors
of the Peoria and Mitchigamia Indians, one mile northwest
of Fort Chartres. It is said of these Indians: <span class="tei tei-q">“They were
formerly brave and warlike, but are degenerated into a
drunken and debauched tribe, and so indolent, as scarcely
to procure a sufficiency of Skins and Furrs to barter for
clothing,”</span> and a pastoral letter of August 7, 1767, from the
Bishop of Quebec to the inhabitants of Kaskaskia shows
the character of the French. The French are told that
if they will not acknowledge the authority of the vicar-general—Father
Meurin, pastor of Cahokia—cease to marry
without the intervention of the priest, and cease to absent
themselves from church services, they will be abandoned
by the bishop as unworthy of his care.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> Two years earlier,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
George Croghan had visited Vincennes, of which he wrote:
<span class="tei tei-q">“I found a village of about eighty or ninety French families
settled on the east side of this river [Wabash], being
one of the finest situations that can be found.... The
French inhabitants, hereabouts, are an idle, lazy people, a
parcel of renegadoes from Canada, and are much worse
than the Indians.”</span><a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> Although slave-holders, a large proportion
of the French were almost abjectly poor. Illiteracy
was very common as is shown by the large proportion
who signed legal documents by their marks.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> The people
had been accustomed to a paternal rule and had not
become acquainted with English methods during the few
years of British rule. Such deeds as were given during
the French period were usually written upon scraps of
paper, described the location of the land deeded either
inaccurately or not at all, and were frequently lost.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> Land holdings were in long narrow strips along the
rivers.<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>

The country was physically in a state of almost primeval
simplicity. The chief highways were the winding rivers,
although roads, likewise winding, connected the various
settlements. These roads were impassable in times of

An early traveler wrote in 1796: <span class="tei tei-q">“The province of the
Illinois is, perhaps, the only spot respecting which travelers
have given no exaggerated accounts; it is superior to any
description which has been made, for local beauty, fertility,
climate, and the means of every kind which nature
has lavished upon it for the facility of commerce.”</span><a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> The
wide-spreading prairies added to the beauty of the
country. Land which now produces one hundred bushels
of corn to the acre must have been capable of producing
wonderful crops at the beginning of its cultivation. Coal
was not known to exist in great quantities in the region
nor was its use as a fuel yet known.

While Gov. Patrick Henry was writing instructions concerning
the organization of government in Illinois, the
British general, Hamilton, was marching to take Vincennes.
Henry did not know this particular fact, but he
had a keen perception of the difficulties, both civil and
military, which awaited the county. On December 12,
1778, without waiting for the formal signing of the act
creating the county, he wrote instructions to George
Rogers Clark, to Col. John Todd, jr., and to Lieut.-Col.
John Montgomery. Clark was instructed to retain the

the affections of the French and Indians, to coöperate with
Clark and give the military department all the aid possible,
to use the French against the British, if the French
were willing, but otherwise to remain on the defensive, to
inculcate in the people an appreciation of the value of
liberty, to see that the inhabitants had justice done them

such having the command of the militia, who are not to

Upon the arrival of the new county-lieutenant, Clark
called a meeting of the citizens of Kaskaskia to meet the
new officer and to elect judges. He introduced Col. Todd
as governor and said that he was the only person in the state
whom he had desired for the place. The people were told
that the government, Virginia, was going to send a
regiment of regular troops for their defense, that the new
governor would arrange and settle their affairs, and that
they would soon become accustomed to the American
system of government. In regard to the election of
judges, Clark said: <span class="tei tei-q">“I pray you to consider the importance

choose the persons most worthy of such posts.”</span><a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> The

Military commissions were promptly made out, those

May 14, 1779. So many of the persons elected judges
were also given military commissions that it seems probable
that the supply of suitable men was small. No fewer
than fourteen such cases occur. Of the militia officers

The position of Illinois among the counties of Virginia
was necessarily anomalous. All counties, except the
County of Illinois, were asked to furnish one twenty-fifth

omitted from the western counties enumerated in <span class="tei tei-q">“An act
for adjusting and settling the titles of claimers to unpatented

cavalry, consisting of one captain, one lieutenant, one
cornet, and thirty-two privates to defend the inhabitants

Some of the incidents of the summer of 1779 indicate
difficulties of the new government. When the governor
was to be absent for a short time, he wrote to Winston,
who as commander of Kaskaskia would be acting governor,
telling him not to impress property, and by all
means to keep up a good understanding with Col. Clark
and the officers. The judges of the court at Kaskaskia
were ordered to hold court <span class="tei tei-q">“at the usual place of holding
court ... any adjournment to the contrary notwithstanding.”</span>
Richard McCarty, of Cahokia, wrote to the county-lieutenant
complaining that the writer's stock had been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
killed by the French inhabitants. McCarty had allowed
his stock to run at large and they had destroyed uninclosed
crops, which crops, he contended, were not in their
proper place. Two months later, McCarty wrote from
Cahokia: <span class="tei tei-q">“Col. Todd residence hear will spoil the people

Great difficulty was experienced in securing supplies for
the soldiers. At times, both troops and people suffered
from lack of clothing. The Spanish refused to allow the
Americans to navigate the Mississippi, Virginia money
entirely lost its credit, hard money was scarce, and peltry
was difficult for the military commissaries to obtain. Col.
Todd, in desperation, refused to allow the commander at
Kaskaskia to pay the people peltry for provisions as had
been promised, and calling the inhabitants in council, he
told them that if they would not sell on the credit of the
state they would be subject to military discipline.<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> The

This great lack of supplies resulted in the impressment of
supplies, in disagreement among the officers, and was a
prominent factor in a resolution to withdraw the troops
from their several situations and concentrate them at a
single point on the Ohio River. The discontent of the
French was extreme, and it was increased by the departure
of Col. Todd for Virginia. The officers who were left in
command ruled with a rod of iron and took cattle, flour,
wood, and other necessaries, without payment.<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>

In the very midst of starvation, the French, unaccustomed
to English ways, were wishing to increase the
expense of government. An unsigned official letter says,
in speaking of affairs in Illinois: <span class="tei tei-q">“I find that justices of
the peace, appointed among them, expect to be paid, this
not being the practice under our laws, there is no provision
for it. Would it not be expedient to restrain these
appointments to a very small number, and for these (if it
be necessary) to require small contributions either from
the litigants or the people at large, as you find would be
most agreeable. In time, I suppose even this might be
discontinued. The Clerks &amp; Sheriffs perhaps may be
paid, as with us, only converting Tobacco fees into their
worth in peltry. As to the rules of decision &amp; modes of

The plan for concentrating most of the Illinois troops at
a single point was carried out in the spring of 1780. The
chief objects sought were to procure supplies and to prevent
the advance of the Spaniards. At first, it was
thought advisable to locate the new fort on the north side
of the Ohio near the Mississippi, and Col. Todd made
some grants of land to such persons as were willing to
settle in the vicinity and assist in raising provisions, but
the fact that Virginia currency, although refused in Illinois,
was accepted in Kentucky caused the fort to be built
south of the Ohio, and it is probable that Todd's grants of
land at the site first proposed lapsed.<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a>
As the troops had
a great need for settlers to raise crops, Capt. Dodge suggested

As the French could neither support the soldiers nor do

that the settlers at Vincennes would consider themselves
abandoned upon the withdrawal of troops. It was proposed
to leave enough troops among the French to satisfy
them, but scarcely had the new fort been established when
the people of Cahokia sent a special messenger to Clark
at Fort Jefferson, the new fort, asking that troops be sent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The condition of the people in the county during the
latter half of 1780 was one of misery. Contemporary
accounts have a melancholy interest. An attack by
Indians upon Fort Jefferson being imminent, the few
troops in the outlying districts were ordered to come to
the aid of the garrison. The order reached Cahokia when
its few defenders were sick and starving. Corn, without
grease or salt, was their only food. Deaths were of frequent
occurrence. The people of the village had petitioned
Col. Montgomery to ease their burden by quartering some
of the troops in other villages, but he refused the request
of other officers for a council and threatened to abandon
the country entirely. In such a condition of affairs, Capt.
McCarty proceeded to obey the orders from Fort Jefferson.
The only boats at the disposal of the garrison were unseaworthy,
so five small boats were pressed for use. On the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
way, several of the famished soldiers became so sick that
they had to be left along the route. Even military discipline
was bad in the country. Capt. McCarty, upon being
arrested for having quarreled with Dodge, because the
latter would not buy food for the starving troops, was left
for months without trial because Col. Montgomery had
left the country and a military court could not be convened.<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a>

Of the same tenor as McCarty's testimony to Illinois
conditions is that of Winston. A remonstrance of the
civil authorities against the extravagance of the military
officers was treated as insolent and impertinent. The
military power refused the civil department the use of the
military prison, even when pay was offered, and made
strenuous efforts to establish military rule. Col. Montgomery
and Capt. Brashears had departed for New
Orleans without settling the account for the peltry which
Todd had committed to the joint care of Montgomery
and Winston. Montgomery was openly accused of having
taken a large amount of public property away with him.
Capt. Dodge was a notorious disturber of the peace, and

by the fact that in 1781, a letter written in French to the
governor of Virginia and said to be signed in the name of
the inhabitants of Vincennes and to give the views of the
people of Vincennes, Kaskaskia, Vermilion, Ouia, etc.,
declared that the French had decided to receive no troops
except those sent by the king of France to aid in defeating
the enemies of the country. The Indians who are
friendly to the French, said the writer, would regard the
coming of Virginia troops as a hostile act. A copy of the

The first important military operation in which the
County of Illinois was concerned, after the well-known
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
movements of Clark and Hamilton, was organized by the
British at Detroit in compliance with a circular letter from
Lord George Germain. The plan was to attack St. Louis,
the French settlements near it on the east side of the
Mississippi, Vincennes, Fort Nelson at the falls of the
Ohio, and Kentucky. Large use was to be made of
Indians, and British emissaries were busy among the tribes
early in 1780. An expedition was to be led against
Kentucky, while diversions should be made at outlying
posts. It was thought that the reduction of St. Louis
would present little difficulty, because it was known to be
unfortified, and was reported to be garrisoned by but
twenty men. In addition to this, it was regarded as an
easy matter to use Indians against the place from the circumstance
that many Indians frequented it. Less assurance
was felt as to holding the place after it should have
been captured, and to make this easier, it was proposed to
appeal to the cupidity of the British fur traders. By the
middle of February, a war-party had been sent out from
Michilimackinac to arouse and act with the Sioux Indians,
and early the next month another party was sent out to
engage Indians to attack St. Louis and the Illinois towns.
Seven hundred and fifty traders, servants, and Indians
having been collected, on the 2d of May they started down
the Mississippi, and at the lead mines, near the present
Galena, seventeen Spanish and American prisoners were
taken. In conjunction with this expedition, another, with
a chosen band of Indians and French, was to advance by
way of Chicago and the Illinois River; a third was to
guard the prairies between the Wabash and the Illinois;
and the chief of the Sioux was to attack St. Genevieve and
Kaskaskia.<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a>

The expedition against St. Louis and the Illinois towns,
as well as in its larger aspect, was not successful. It was
impossible to keep it secret and as early as March, an
attack was expected. Spanish and Americans joined in
repulsing the intruders. Another potent element in the
failure was the treachery of some of the traders who acted
as leaders for the British, notably that of Ducharme and
Calvé, who had a lucrative trade and regarded the prospect
of increasing it by the proposed attack as doubtful.
In the last week of May, 1780, the attack on St. Louis was
made. Several persons were killed, but the place was not
taken. Cahokia was beleaguered for three days, but it
was so well defended by George Rogers Clark that on the
third night the enemy withdrew, when Clark hastened to
intercept the expedition against Kentucky, while the Illinois
and Spanish troops pursued the retreating enemy and
burned the towns of the Sauk and Fox Indians. The
British were much chagrined at the result of the expedition,
yet they resolved to continue their plan of using
Indians and sending out several parties at once.<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a>

An expedition which gains much interest from the character
of its leader was that of Col. Augustin Mottin de la
Balme. This man had been commissioned quartermaster
of gendarmerie, by the authorities of Versailles, in 1766;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had come to America and been recommended by Silas
Deane and Benjamin Franklin to the president of Congress,
John Hancock, as a man who would be of service in
training cavalry; had been breveted lieutenant-colonel of
cavalry, in May, 1777; made inspector of cavalry, with the
rank of colonel, in July following; and had resigned in October
of the same year. The next year, a public notice, in
French with English and German translations, announced
that carpenters, bakers, and some other classes of laborers
could find shelter and employment at a workshop
established by La Balme, twenty-eight miles from Philadelphia.<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a>
In the summer of 1780, La Balme went from
Fort Pitt to the Illinois country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A contemporary who writes from Vincennes speaks of
La Balme as a French colonel. He was regarded by the
Americans with much suspicion. Capt. Dalton, the American
commander at Vincennes, whose character was later
much questioned, allowed him to go among the Indians,<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a>
whereupon La Balme advised them to send word to the
tribes which Clark was preparing to attack and to warn
them of their danger. La Balme also ingratiated himself
with the discontented French, asking why they did not
drive <span class="tei tei-q">“these vagabonds,”</span> the American soldiers, away, and
saying that to refuse to furnish provisions was the most
efficient method. <span class="tei tei-q">“Everything he advances tends to
advance the French interest and depreciate the American.
The people here are easily misled; buoy'd up with the
flattering hopes of being again subject to the king of
France, he could easily prevail on them to drive every
American out of the Place and this appears to me to be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his Plan.”</span> After thoroughly stirring up the people at
Vincennes, the adventurer left, with an escort of thirty
French and Indians, to visit Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and
St. Louis. He and Col. Montgomery, then the superior
officer in Illinois, did not meet, and he received not the
slightest countenance from the Spanish commandant at
St. Louis. By the French inhabitants, La Balme <span class="tei tei-q">“was
received ... just as the Jews would receive the
Messiah—was conducted from the post here [at Kaskaskia]
by a large detachment of the inhabitants as well as
different tribes of Indians.”</span> The French in the towns
near the Mississippi were so enthusiastic that La Balme
had little difficulty in raising forty or fifty troops for an
expedition against Detroit. Some of the American
soldiers at Cahokia deserted to him, and when placed
under arrest by the military authorities were rescued by a
mob. On October 5, 1780, after telling the Indians to be
quiet because they would see the French in Illinois in the
spring, the French troops set out from Cahokia.<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a>

The troops from Illinois were to be joined by a body
from Vincennes, but without waiting for them La Balme
pushed on to the Miami towns, where he hoped to capture
a British Indian trader who was especially hated by the
French. The trader was not found, but his store of goods
to the amount of one hundred horse-loads was seized.
The expected reinforcements not arriving, La Balme felt
too weak to attack Detroit and started to return. He was
attacked by the Indians on the river Aboite, eleven miles
southwest of the present Fort Wayne, and he and some
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thirty of his men were killed and at least one hundred
horses, richly laden with plunder, were taken by the
Indians. It was reported that disaffected inhabitants of
Detroit had concealed five hundred stands of arms with
which to assist the forces of La Balme in taking the place.
Among La Balme's papers, which fell into the hands of the
British and are now in the Canadian archives, were
addresses, in French, by M. Mottin de la Balme, French
colonel, etc., to the French settled on the Mississippi, dated
St. Louis, September 17, 1780; a declaration, in French,
in the name of the inhabitants of the village of Cahokia,
addressed to La Balme: <span class="tei tei-q">“We unanimously request you to
listen with a favorable ear to the declaration which we
venture to present to you, touching all the bad treatment
we have suffered patiently since the Virginian troops unfortunately
arrived amongst us till now,”</span> dated Cahokia,
September 21, 1780; a note from F. Trottier, a member
of the court of Cahokia, elected under the Virginia government,
to La Balme, saying that no meeting can be held
until Sunday next, when he hopes the young men will
show themselves worthy the high idea La Balme has of
them, but that at present there are only twelve entirely
determined to follow him wherever he goes, although
others may follow their example, and asking La Balme
to receive depositions against the Virginians, dated
Cahokia, September 27, 1780; a petition, in French,
addressed to the Chevalier de la Luzerne, minister plenipotentiary
from France to the United States, by inhabitants
of Post Vincennes, dated Vincennes, August 22, 1780;

timed as to come when the Indians in the vicinity of St.
Josephs were out hunting. The place was taken without
difficulty, the traders of the place were captured and plundered,
and the party, laden with booty, set out on the
route to Chicago. A pursuing party was quickly organized
and at the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rivière du Chemin</span></span>, a small stream in Indiana,
emptying into the southeastern part of Lake Michigan,
the returning victors were summoned to surrender, on

In the very midst of winter, on January 2, 1781, an
expedition commanded by Eugenio Pierre, a Spanish captain

twenty men from Cahokia, and two hundred Indians.

The purpose of the expedition was to retaliate upon the
British for the attack on St. Louis and for the defeat of
La Balme. On the march, severe difficulties incident to
the season were encountered. The post was easily taken,
the Indians were conciliated by a liberal proportion of the
booty, the Spanish flag was raised and the Illinois country
with St. Josephs and its dependencies was claimed for the
crown of Spain. The British flag was given to Commandant
Cruzat, of St. Louis. These proceedings made some
prominent Americans fear that Spain would advance
claims to the region at the close of the Revolution.<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a>

In the summer of 1781, a party of seven men was sent
out by the commandant at Michilimackinac with a letter
to the inhabitants of Cahokia and Kaskaskia asking them
to furnish troops to be paid by the king of England, and
to assume the defensive against the Spaniards. The men
reached St. Louis before visiting Cahokia or Kaskaskia,
and were arrested by the Spanish commandant, who sent
a copy of the letter to Major Williams, knowing no officer
in Illinois superior to him. This created jealousy at
Cahokia and Kaskaskia, each of several officers claiming
superiority. Charles Gratiot, a man of some ability, who
had removed from Cahokia to St. Louis because unable to
endure the lawlessness at the former place, wrote that he
did not know what course the Illinois people might have
taken if Cruzat had not intercepted the British agents.

asked pay for his services as lieutenant, in order that he
might not be a charge to his friends—a thing which
would be shameful to one of noble descent. He wished to
be able to support his family and to go with Clark on a
proposed expedition. His petition was supported by a
certificate from Col. Montgomery, testifying that Demunbrunt
had been active in his military duty, had gone
against the savages in the spring of 1780, had gone on the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Expedition up the Wabash,”</span> and had gone to the relief
of Fort Jefferson when Montgomery could raise only

The military troubles continued. The commander at
Vincennes reported his troops as destitute and unpaid.
Richard Winston, of Kaskaskia, who had succeeded Todd
as head of the civil government in Illinois, was arrested
by military force and put in jail. The prisoner claimed
that the proceedings were wholly irregular and that he
was unacquainted with the nature of the charge against
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him.<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> The next year, he was accused of treason, the
accuser declaring that Winston had proposed to turn Illinois
over to Spain, but that his proposal had been despised
by the Spanish commandant.<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> Upon Winston was
also laid the chief blame for the discontent of the French,
he being charged with having told Montgomery that the
French were strangers to liberty and must be ruled with a
rod of iron or the bayonet, and that if he wanted anything
he must send his guards and take it by force; while, at
the same time, he told the French that the military was a
band of robbers and came to Illinois for plunder.<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a> However,
numerous and well-founded as the accusations might
be, both accused and accuser laid their claims for salary

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another visitor to the Board of Commissioners was
Francis Carbonneaux, prothonotary and notary public for
the Illinois country. Although he came to get some
private affairs settled, his chief mission was to lay before
the Board the confusion in Illinois, and the Board correctly
surmised that if Virginia did not afford relief the messenger
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would proceed to Congress.<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> It was but natural that at
this time, the people of Illinois should be in doubt as to
whom to present their petition, because Virginia had
offered to cede her western lands to Congress, although
the terms of cession were not yet agreed upon. Carbonneaux
complained that Illinois was wholly without law
or government; that the magistrates, from indolence or
sinister views, had for some time been lax in the execution
of their duties, and were now altogether without
authority; that crimes of the greatest enormity might be
committed with impunity, and a man be murdered in his
own house and no one regard it; that there was neither
sheriff nor prison; and to crown the general confusion,
that many persons had made large purchases of three
and four hundred leagues, and were endeavoring to have
themselves established lords of the soil, as some had done
in Canada, and to have settlements made on these purchases,
composed of a set of men wholly subservient to
their views. The Spanish traded freely in Illinois, but
strictly prohibited Illinois from trading in Spanish dominions.
Complaint was also made that the Board of
Commissioners had not settled the Illinois accounts in
peltry according to the known rule and practice, namely:
that fifty pounds of peltry should represent one hundred
livres in money.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The petitioners prayed that a president of judicature
be sent to them, with executive powers to a certain
extent, and that subordinate civil officers be appointed, to
reside in each village or station, with power to hear and
decide all causes upon obligations not exceeding three
hundred dollars, higher amounts to be determined by a
court to be held at Kaskaskia and to be composed of the
president and a majority of the magistrates. It was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
desired that the grant in which the Kaskaskia settlements
lay should be considered as one district. It contained five
villages, of which Kaskaskia and Cahokia were the
largest. The grant extended to the headwaters of the
Illinois River on the north. The land had been granted
to the settlers by the Indians, and the Indians, having
given their consent by solemn treaties, had never denied
the sale. The tract referred to was probably the two
purchases of the Illinois Company. Maps give but one of
these and, in fact, the other was said to be so described as
to comprise <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a line only</span></em>. Naturally, this fact was not
known at the time of purchase.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was frankly acknowledged that Illinois had no man
fitted for the office of president. It was hoped that Virginia
would furnish one, and would send with him a
company of regulars to act under his direction and enforce
laws and authority. The president should be empowered
to grant land in small tracts to immigrants. The
privilege of trading in Spanish waters, especially on the
Missouri, was much desired. It was said that Carbonneaux
<span class="tei tei-q">“appears to have been instructed as to the ground of his
message by the better disposed part of the inhabitants of
the country whose complaints he represents.”</span><a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a>

At the time of Carbonneaux's petition, there was no legal
way by which newcomers to Illinois could acquire public
land. Virginia had prepared to open a land-office, soon
after the conquest of the Illinois country, but she seems
to have heeded the recommendation of Congress that no
unappropriated land be sold during the war.<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> Some grants
had been made by Todd, Demunbrunt, the Indians, and
others with less show of right, but they were made without
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
governmental authority. The Indians had presented a
tract of land to Clark, but the view consistently held was
that individuals could not receive Indian land merely upon
their own initiative.<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a> One of the grants made at Vincennes,
which seems to have been a typical one, was
signed by Le Grand, <span class="tei tei-q">“Colonel commandant and President
of the Court,”</span> and was made by the authority granted to
the magistrates of the court of Vincennes by John Todd,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Colonel and Grand civil Judge for the United States.”</span>
The purpose of the grant, which comprised four hundred
arpents <span class="tei tei-q">“in circumference,”</span> was to induce immigration.<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a>

On March 1, 1784, Virginia ceded her western lands to
the United States, thus transferring to the general government
the question of land titles. The country had been
in a state of unconcealed anarchy for more than two
years, all semblance of Virginia authority having ceased,
and the cession is quite as much a tribute to Virginia's
shrewdness as to her generosity. Never was so large a
present made with less sacrifice. The cession was made
with the following conditions, some of which were to have
a direct and potent influence upon the settlement of the
ceded region:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The territory should be formed into states of not less
than one hundred nor more than one hundred and fifty
square miles each;
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Virginia's expenses in subduing and governing the
territory should be reimbursed by the United States;

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Settlers should have their <span class="tei tei-q">“possessions and titles
confirmed;”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. One hundred and fifty thousand acres, or less, should
be granted to George Rogers Clark and his soldiers;
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. The Virginia military bounty lands should be located
north of the Ohio River, unless there should prove to be
enough land for the purpose south of that river;
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. The proceeds from the sale of the lands should be
for the United States, severally.<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a>

In the year of the Virginia cession, Congress passed the
Ordinance for the Government of the Western Territory,
but as it never went into effect, its importance is slight
except as indicative of the trend of public feeling on the
subjects which it involved. Should Jefferson's plan,
proposed at this time, have been carried out, Illinois would
have been parts of the states of Polypotamia, Illinois,
Assenisipia, and Saratoga.<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a>

Carbonneaux, the messenger from Illinois to Virginia,
carried his petition to Congress. Congress paid the messenger,
referred the petition to a committee, and upon the
report of the committee voted to choose one or more
commissioners to go to Illinois and investigate conditions
there.<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a> No record of the appointment of such commissioners
has been found. Congress considered Carbonneaux's
petition early in 1785. In November of the same
year comes a record of the anarchy in Illinois. This was
addressed to George Rogers Clark, who was the hope of
the people of that neglected country. The commandant
at St. Louis is afraid of an attack from the Royalists at
Michilimackinac, or he has given orders for all the people
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<span class="tei tei-q">“The Indians are very troublesome on the rivers, and
declare an open war with the Americans, which I am sure

come into this country. For my part, it is impossible to

During the year 1786, George Rogers Clark was the
chief factor in Illinois affairs. He was regarded by the
people as their advocate before Congress. In March,
seven of the leading men of Vincennes, at the request of
the French and American inhabitants, sent a petition to
him asking him to persuade Congress to send troops to
defend them from the Indians, and also saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“We
have unanimously agreed to present a petition to Congress
for relief, apprehensive that the Deed we received from an
office, established or rather continued by Col<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">o</span></span>
Todd for lands, may possibly be a slender foundation; so that after
we have passed through a scene of suffering in forming
settlements in a remote and dangerous part may have the
mortification to be totally deprived of our improvements.”</span><a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a>
In June, seventy-one American subscribers from Vincennes,
<span class="tei tei-q">“in the County of Illinois,”</span> asked Congress to
settle their land-titles and give them a government.
They held land from grants from an office established by
Col. Todd, whose validity they questioned. The commandant
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and magistracy had resigned because of the
disobedience of the people. There was no executive, no
law, no government, and the Indians were very hostile.<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href="#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Clark was not unmindful of the needs of the people.
He wrote to the president of Congress: <span class="tei tei-q">“The inhabitants
of the different towns in the Illinois are worthy the
attention of Congress. They have it in their power to be
of infinite service to us, and might act as a great barrier to
the frontier, if under proper regulation; but having no
law or government among them, they are in great confusion,
and without the authority of Congress is extended
to them, they must, in all probability, fall a sacrifice to the
savages, who may take advantage of the disorder and
want of proper authority in that country. I have recommended
it to them, to re-assume their former customs,
and appoint temporary officers until the pleasure of
Congress is known, which I have flattered them would be
in a short time. How far the recommendation will answer
the desired purpose is not yet known.”</span><a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Clark's fears of the Indians were only too well grounded.
During the summer, the American settlers were compelled
to retire to a fort at Bellefontaine, and four of their number
were killed. At the same time, about twenty Americans
were killed about Vincennes. The French were still safe
from Indian attacks and were very angry because the
Americans complained of existing conditions.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a> The strife
between the French and the Americans at Vincennes, over
the proper relations of the whites to the Indians, became
intense. The French contended that the Indians should
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be allowed to come and go freely, while the Americans
held that it was unsafe to grant such freedom. At last,
upon the occasion of the killing of an Indian by the
Americans, after they had been attacked by the Indians,
the French citizens ordered all persons, who had not permission
to settle from the government under which they
last resided, to leave at once and at their own risk. The
French told the Americans plainly that they were not
wanted, and that they, the French, did not know whether
the place belonged to the United States or to Great
Britain.<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> This last assertion was probably true. The
British Michilimackinac Company had a large trading-house
at Cahokia for supplying the Indians, they held
Detroit, and their machinations among the Indians were
constant. The feeling of all intelligent Americans in
Illinois must have been expressed by John Edgar when
he wrote that the Illinois country was totally lost unless a
government should soon be established.<a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a> Clark
wrote a vigorous letter to the people at Vincennes, telling them
that unless they stopped quarreling military rule would
be established; that the government established under
Virginia was still in force, having been confirmed by
Congress upon the acceptance of the Virginia deed of
cession, and that the court, if depleted, should be filled by
election.<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href="#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In one respect, even during this trying period, the
western country gave promise of its future growth.
There was a large crop. Flour and pork, quoted,
strangely enough, together, sold at the Falls of Ohio at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
twelve shillings per hundred pounds, while Indian corn
sold at nine pence per bushel.<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a>

On August 24, 1786, Congress ordered its secretary to
inform the inhabitants of Kaskaskia that a government was
being prepared for them.<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a> In 1787, conditions in the Illinois
country became too serious to be ignored. The Indian
troubles were grave and persistent, but graver still was
the danger of the rebellion or secession of the Western
Country or else of a war with Spain. The closure of the
Mississippi by Spain made the West desperate. Discontent,
anarchy, and petitions might drag a weary length,
but when troops raised without authority were quartered
at Vincennes, when these troops seized Spanish goods, and
impressed the property of the inhabitants of Vincennes,
and proposed to treat with the Indians, the time for action
was at hand. In April, Gen. Josiah Harmar, then at Falls
of Ohio, was ordered to move the greater part of his
troops to Vincennes to restore order among the distracted
people at that place. Intruders upon the public lands
were to be removed, and the lawless and illegally levied
troops were to be dispersed.<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Arrived at Vincennes, Gen. Harmar proceeded with
vigor. The resolution of Congress against intruders on
the public lands was published in English and in French.
The inhabitants, especially the Americans whose hold on
their lands was the more insecure, were dismayed, and
French and Americans each prepared a petition to Congress,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and appointed Bartholomew Tardiveau, who was
to go to Congress within a month, as their agent.
Tardiveau was especially fitted for this task by his intimate
acquaintance with the land grants of the region.
Each party at Vincennes also prepared an address to Gen.
Harmar, the Americans declaring that they were settled
on French lands and feared that their lands would be
taken from them without payment and asking aid from
Congress, and the French expressing their joy at being
freed from their former bad government. Many of Clark's
militia had made tomahawk-rights, and this added to the
confusion of titles.<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From August 9 to 16, Gen. Harmar, with an officer and
thirty men, some Indian hunters, and Tardiveau, journeyed
overland from Vincennes to Kaskaskia, where conditions
were to be investigated. The August sun poured down
its rays upon the parched prairies and dwindling streams.
Water was bad and scarce, but buffalo, deer, bear, and
smaller game were abundant.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Harmar found life in the settlements he visited as crude
as the path he traveled. Kaskaskia was a French village of
one hundred and ninety-one men, old and young, with an
accompaniment of women and children of various mixtures
of white and red blood. Cahokia, then the metropolis, had
two hundred and thirty-nine Frenchmen, old and young,
with an accompaniment similarly mixed. Between these
settlements was Bellefontaine, a small stockade, inhabited
altogether by Americans, who had settled without authority.
The situation was a beautiful one; the land was fertile; there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was no taxation, and the people had an abundance to live
upon. They were much alarmed when told of their precarious
state respecting a title to their lands, and they gave
Tardiveau a petition to carry to Congress. On the route
to Cahokia, another stockade, Grand Ruisseau, similarly
inhabited by Americans, was passed. There were about
thirty other American intruders in the fertile valleys near
the Mississippi, and they, too, gave Tardiveau a petition to
Congress.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Kaskaskia, Peoria, Cahokia, and Mitcha tribes of
Indians numbered only about forty or fifty members, of
whom but ten or eleven individuals composed the Kaskaskia
tribe; but this does not mean that danger from
the Indians was not great, because other and more hostile
tribes came in great numbers to hunt in the Illinois country.
The significance of the diminished numbers of these
particular tribes lies in the fact that they had the strongest
claim to that part of Illinois which would be first needed
for settlement. At Kaskaskia and Cahokia, the French
were advised to obey their magistrates until Congress had
a government ready for them, and Cahokia was advised to
put its militia into better shape, and to put any turbulent
or refractory persons under guard until a government could
be instituted.<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having finished his work in the settlements near the
Mississippi, Harmar returned to Vincennes, where he held
councils with the Indians, and on October 1, set out on his
return to Fort Harmar. Although without authority to
give permanent redress, he had persuaded the French at
Vincennes to relinquish their charter and to throw themselves
upon the generosity of Congress. <span class="tei tei-q">“As it would

visit was doubtless of some value, but he had not been
gone five weeks when Hamtramck wrote to him: <span class="tei tei-q">“Our

establish some mode of government, for I never saw so
injudicious administration. Application has repeatedly
been made to me for redress. I have avoided to give
answer, not knowing how far my powers extended. In
my opinion, the Minister of War should have that matter
determined, and sincerely beg you would push it. I confess

Not earlier than the 24th of November, Tardiveau set out
for Congress with his petitions from the Illinois country.
Harmar was much pleased to have so able a messenger,
and spoke of him as sensible, well-informed, and able to
give a minute and particular description of the western
country, particularly the Illinois. He had been preceded
to Congress by Joseph Parker, of Kaskaskia. Harmar
seems to have regarded Tardiveau as a sort of antidote to
Parker, for he closes his recommendation of the former by
saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“There have been some imposters before Congress,
particularly one Parker, a whining, canting Methodist,
a kind of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">would-be governor</span></em>. He is extremely
unpopular at Kaskaskia, and despised by the inhabitants.”</span><a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This detracts from the value of Parker's representations,
which had been made in a letter to St. Clair, the President
of Congress. After explaining that when he left Kaskaskia,
on June 5, 1787, the people did not have an
intended petition ready, Parker complained of the lack of
government in Illinois, the presence of British traders, the
depopulation of the country by the inducements of the
Spaniards, and the high rate at which it was proposed to
sell lands. His complaints were true, although he may
have failed to give them in their proper
proportion.<a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106" href="#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a>

On July 13, 1787, the Ordinance of 1787 had been
passed by Congress. The Illinois country was at that
time ready for war against the Spanish, who persisted in
closing the Mississippi. The troops, irregularly levied by
George Rogers Clark at Vincennes, had seized some
Spanish goods on the theory that if the Spanish would
not allow the United States to navigate the lower Mississippi,
the Spanish should not be allowed to navigate the
upper Mississippi. John Rice Jones, later the first lawyer
in Illinois, was Clark's commissary.<a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href="#note_107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Ordinance of 1787 was the only oil then at hand
for these troubled waters. The situation in Illinois was a
complicated one, and probably the numerical weakness of
the population alone saved the country from disastrous
results. The few Americans in Illinois desired governmental
protection from the Spanish, the Indians, the
British, and any Americans who might seek to jump the
claims of the first squatters; the few French desired
protection from the Spanish, the Americans, the British,
and soon from the Indians; the numerous Indians, permanent
or transient, desired protection from the Spanish, the
Americans, and in rare cases from an Americanized
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Frenchman. Americans, French, Spanish, British, and
Indians made an opportunity for many combinations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the French inhabitants, the somewhat paternal
character of the government provided for by the Ordinance
was a matter of no concern. The great rock of offense
for them was the prohibition of slavery. An exodus to
the Spanish side of the Mississippi resulted and St. Louis
profited by what the older villages of Illinois lost.<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href="#note_108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a> In
addition to a justifiable feeling of uncertainty as to
whether they would be allowed to retain their slaves, the
credulous French had their fears wrought upon by persons
interested in the sale of Spanish lands. These persons
took pains to inculcate the belief that all slaves would be
released upon American occupancy. The Spanish officials
were also active. The commandant at St. Louis wrote to
the French at Kaskaskia, Cahokia, and Vincennes, respectively,
inviting them to settle west of the Mississippi and
offering free lands.<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a> Mr. Tardiveau, the agent for the
Illinois settlers to Congress, tried to induce Congress to
repeal the anti-slavery clause of the Ordinance. He said
that it threatened to be the ruin of Illinois. Designing
persons had told the French that the moment Gen. St.
Clair arrived all their slaves would be free. Failing in his
efforts to secure a repeal, he wrote to Gen. St. Clair, asking
him to secure from Congress a resolution giving the true
intent of the act.<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a> In this letter, Tardiveau advanced the
doctrine, later so much used, that the evils of slavery
would be mitigated by its diffusion.<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a> The first panic of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the French only gradually subsided and the question of
slavery was a persistent one.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the most industrious of those interested in the
sale of Spanish lands was George Morgan, of New
Jersey.<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a>
In 1788, he tried to secure land in Illinois also.
He and his associates petitioned Congress to sell them a
tract of land on the Mississippi. A congressional committee
found upon investigation that the proposed purchase
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
comprised all of the French settlements in
Illinois.<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a>
Thereupon was passed the Act of June 20, 1788. According
to its provisions, the French inhabitants of Illinois
were to be confirmed in their possessions and each family
which was living in the district before the year 1783 was
to be given a bounty of four hundred acres. These bounty-lands
were to be laid off in three parallelograms, at Kaskaskia,
Prairie du Rocher, and Cahokia, respectively.
They were to be bounded on the east by the ridge of
rocks—a natural formation trending from north to south,
a short distance to the east of the French settlements.
Morgan was to be sold a large described tract for not less
than sixty-six and two-thirds cents per acre. Indian
titles were to be extinguished if necessary.<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Act of June 20, 1788, is an important landmark in
the settlement of Illinois. The grant of bounty-lands
was made for the purpose of giving the French settlers a
means of support when the fur-trade and hunting should
have become unprofitable from the advance of American
settlement. This was a clear acknowledgment that the
Indians were right in believing, as they did, that the
American settlement would be fatal to Indian hunting-grounds.
The Indians were soon bitterly hostile. Then,
too, the claims of the settlers to land, founded upon
French, British, or Virginia grants, were to be investigated.
This investigation dragged on year after year, even for
decades, and as it was the policy of the United States
not to sell public land in Illinois until these claims were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
settled, the country became a great squatters'<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a> camp.
The length of the investigation was doubtless due in part
to the utter carelessness of the French in giving and in
keeping their evidences of title.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By a congressional resolution of August 28, 1788, it was
provided that the lands donated to Illinois settlers should
be located east, instead of west, of the ridge of rocks. As
this would throw the land too far from the settlements to
be available, petitions followed for the restoration of the
provisions of June 20, and in 1791 the original location
was decreed. By a resolution of August 29, 1788, the
governor of the Northwest Territory was ordered to carry
out the provisions of the acts of June 20 and August 28,
1788, respectively.<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href="#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The beginning of operations, in accordance with the acts
just cited, was delayed by the fact that the governor and
judges, appointed under the Ordinance of 1787, and who
alone could institute government under it, did not reach
the Illinois country until 1790. In the meantime, anarchy
continued. Contemporary accounts give a good idea of the
attempts at government during the time, and the fact of
their great interest, combined with the fact that most of
them are yet unpublished, seems to warrant treatment of
the subject at some length.

The court at Kaskaskia met more than a score of times
during 1787 and 1788. Its record consists in large part of
mere meetings and adjournments. All members of the
court were French, while litigants and the single jury
recorded were Americans. Jurors from Bellefontaine
received forty-five livres each, and those from Prairie du

least as bad. <span class="tei tei-q">“It was the most unjust court that could

livers; total in peltry, 180 livers—which is 360 in money. So
that a man who had twenty or thirty dollars due, was obliged
to pay, if he wanted a court, 180 livers in peltry: This
court also never granted an execution, but only took care
to have the fees of the court paid. The government of
this country has been in the Le Gras and Gamelin family
for a long time, to the great dissatisfaction of the people,
who presented me a Petition some days ago, wherein they
complained of the injustice of their court—in consequence

Mississippi was closed to Americans. Joseph St. Marie, of
Vincennes, sent his clerk with a load of peltry to be traded
to the Indians on the banks of the Mississippi. His goods
were seized and confiscated by the Spanish commander at
the Arkansas Post. The commander said that his orders

In September, 1789, Hamtramck received the following
petition from Kaskaskia:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-q">“The inhabitants of Kaskaskias, in the Illinois, beg
leave to address you, as the next commanding officer in
the service of the United States, to lay before you the
deplorable situation we are reduced to, and the absolute
necessity of our being speedily succoured to prevent as
well our total ruin, as that of the place.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Indians are greatly more numerous than the white
people, and are rather hostilely inclined; the name of an
American among them is a disgrace, because we have no
superior. Our horses, horned cattle, and corn are stolen
and destroyed without the power of making any effectual
resistance. Our houses are in ruin and decay; our lands
are uncultivated; debtors absconded and absconding; our
little commerce destroyed. We are apprehensive of a

by the hands of Savages.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We are well convinced that all these misfortunes have
befallen us for want of some superior, or commanding
authority; for ever since the cession of this Territory to
Congress, we have been neglected as an abandoned people,
to encounter all the difficulties that are always attendant
upon anarchy and confusion; neither did we know from
authority until latterly, to what power we were subject.
The greater part of our citizens have left the country on
this account to reside in the Spanish dominions; others
are now following, and we are fearful, nay, certain, that
without your assistance, the small remainder will be
obliged to follow their example.</span>

an almost deserted country from destruction, and to order

you will make order for the establishment of a civil court
to take place immediately and to continue in force until
the pleasure of his Excellency the Governor shall be

Hamtramck responded to the petition by saying that
sickness prevailed among the troops at Vincennes to such
an extent that twenty men could not be sent thence to
Kaskaskia, but that the request would be sent to headquarters.
As to the civil department, the people were
advised to elect two or three magistrates in every village.
These should prevent debtors from leaving, and should
levy on the goods of such debtors as had already gone to
the Spanish side. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let your magistrates be respectable
men by their moral character, as well as in point of property;
let them attend with vigilance to all disputes that

of October 27, 1789. The next day, Edgar wrote to
Hamtramck saying that it was probable that the recommendations
in regard to establishing a civil government
could not be carried out without a military force. The
French were easily governed by a superior, but they knew
nothing of government by an equal. Indians were constantly
incited by the Spanish. They stole horses and
escaped to the Spanish side. Edgar enclosed correspondence
and depositions showing that on the night of the
eighth of October, John Dodge and Michael Antanya,
with a party of whites and Indians, came from the Spanish
side to Kaskaskia, made an unsuccessful attempt to carry
off some of Edgar's slaves, and threatened to burn the
village. He adds <span class="tei tei-q">“[In] the spring it is impossible I can
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stand my ground, surrounded as we are by savage enemies.
I have waited five years in hopes of a government; I shall
still wait until March, as I may be able to withstand them
in the winter season, but if no succour nor government
should then arrive, I shall be compelled to abandon the
country, and I shall go to live at St. Louis. Inclination,
interest and love for the country prompt me to reside here,
but when in so doing it is ten to one but both my life and
property will fall a sacrifice, you nor any impartial mind
can blame me for the part I shall take.”</span><a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One day later, John Rice Jones wrote from Kaskaskia.
The answer to the petition sent by Ducoigne and addressed
to Ledru and Edgar, had been opened by the latter in the
absence and by the consent of the former. Ledru had
gone to be priest at St. Louis. At first he had refused the
offer of the position, but when he received his tithes at
Kaskaskia, he found that they would not support him, so
he was compelled to move. He met no better treatment
than de la Valiniere and Gibault before him, and no priest
was likely to fare any better until a government was
established. St. Pierre, priest at Cahokia, had gone to be
priest at Ste. Genevieve, and it was said that Gibault was
to be priest at L'Anse a la Graisse (New Madrid).
Morgan had been coolly received at New Orleans, and his
boasted settlement at New Madrid was almost broken up.
The attempted seizure of Edgar's negroes could not be
punished, because there was no one with authority to
remonstrate with the Spanish, and private remonstrances
were unheeded. The Spanish were making every effort to
depopulate Illinois. They well knew that the people
would follow their priests. Flattering offers had been
made to Edgar by the Spanish, among them being free
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lands, no taxes, and free permission to work at the lead
mines and salt springs. He had refused all offers, but if
government was not established by the next March he
would go to St. Louis, and if he went, Kaskaskia would
be practically at an end. Twenty-four British trading-boats
from Michilimackinac were on the Mississippi on
the American side opposite the mouth of the Missouri.
Their purpose was to attract Indian trade.<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href="#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a>

With his coming anarchy technically ceased, but naturally
the institution of an orderly government was a gradual
process. In August, Tardiveau wrote to Hamtramck
from Kaskaskia, saying that he hoped that Maj. Wyllys
had given Hamtramck such a specimen of the difficulty
of establishing a regular government and organizing the
militia in Illinois as would induce the sending of a few
regular troops from Vincennes. Even ten men would be
a help. The Indians daily stole horses, and Tardiveau
tried to raise a force to go and punish the offenders, but
he was effectually opposed by a lawless band of ringleaders.
A militia law and the Illinois civil power were
useless to remedy the matter. There were plenty of provisions
in Illinois to supply any soldiers that might be
sent.<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a> Tardiveau

On June 20, 1788, a congressional committee reported
that there were about eighty families at Kaskaskia, twelve
at Prairie du Rocher, four or five at Fort Chartres and St.
Philips, and about fifty at Cahokia, making one hundred
and forty-six or one hundred and forty-seven families
in these villages.<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href="#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a> In 1766-7, the same villages, with

It is not surprising that the population of the Illinois
country decreased from 1765 to 1790. During these years,
British and Americans had attempted to impose upon the
French settlers a form of government for which they had
neither desire nor aptitude. The attempt to immediately
transform a subject people was a signal failure, but neither
the attempt nor the failure was unique.

A proclamation issued by Estevan Miro, Governor
and Intendant of the Provinces of Louisiana and Florida
in 1789, offered to immigrants a liberal donation of land,
graduated according to the number of laborers in the
family; freedom of religion and from payment of tithes,
although no public worship except Catholic would be
allowed; freedom from taxation; and a free market at
New Orleans for produce or manufactures. All settlers

To the professional rover, the inability to secure a title
to land was the cause of small concern, but the more
substantial and desirable the settler, the more concerned
was he about the matter. Settlement and improvements
were retarded. Before the affairs of the Ohio Company
had progressed far enough to permit sales of land to
settlers, the little company at Marietta saw, with deep
chagrin, thousands of settlers float by on their way to
Kentucky, where land could be bought.<a id="noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href="#note_148"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a> Squatters in

would soon be offered for sale. The natural result was
petitions for the right of preëmption, because without such
a right, the settler was in danger of losing whatever
improvements he had made. In 1790, James Piggott and
forty-five others petitioned for such a right. The petitioners
stated that they had settled since 1783 and had
suffered much from Indians. They could not cultivate
their land except under guard. Seventeen families had no
more tillable land than four could tend. The land on which
they lived was the property of two individuals.<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href="#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a>

Petitions from various classes of settlers, not provided
for by the acts of June 20, August 28, and August 29,
1788, led Congress to pass the act of March 3, 1791. By
this act, four hundred acres was to be given to each head
of a family who, in 1783, was resident in the Illinois
country or at Vincennes, and who had since moved from
the one to the other. The same donation was to be made
to all persons who had moved away, if they should return
within five years. Such persons should also have confirmed
to them the land they originally held. This was intended
to bring back persons who had gone to the Spanish side of
the Mississippi. Grants previously made by courts having
no authority should be confirmed to persons who had
made improvements, to an extent not exceeding four
hundred acres to any one person. As these lands had in
some cases been repeatedly sold, the parties making the
improvements were frequently guiltless of any knowledge
of fraud. The Cahokia commons were confirmed to that
village. One hundred acres was to be granted to each
militiaman enrolled on August 1, 1790, and who had
received no other grant.<a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150" href="#note_150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a> This act throws considerable

It is not strange that the act of March 3, 1791, made
provisions intended to induce the Americans who had emigrated
to the Spanish possessions to return. The history
of the threatened Spanish aggression upon the western
part of the United States is known in essence to anyone
who has made the slightest special study of the period at
which it was at its height. Morgan's scheme for a purchase
of land in Illinois was not carried out, and he turned
his attention to peopling his settlement at New Madrid.
Down the Mississippi to New Orleans seemed the natural
route for Illinois commerce. Slavery flourished unmolested
west of the Mississippi. In 1794, Baron de Carondolet
gave orders to the governor of Natchez to incite the
Chickasaw Indians to expel the Americans from Fort
Massac. The governor refused to obey the order, because
Fort Massac had been occupied by the Americans in
pursuance of a request by the Spanish representative at
the capital of the United States that the president would
put a stop to the proposed expedition of the French
against the Spanish. The claim was advanced by Carondolet
that the Americans had no right to the land on
which the fort stood, but that the land belonged to the
Chickasaws, who were independent allies of Spain. Two
other reasons given for not obeying the order were that it
would preclude the successful issue of the Spanish intrigue
for the separation of Kentucky from the United States,
and would hinder negotiations, then pending, for a commercial
treaty between Spain and the United States.<a id="noteref_152" name="noteref_152" href="#note_152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">152</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Carondolet regarded the Indians as Spain's best defence

and in anticipation of the proposed French expedition of
George Rogers Clark, a garrison of thirty men and an
officer was placed at Ste. Genevieve, opposite Kaskaskia.
Carondolet said: <span class="tei tei-q">“This will suffice to prevent the smuggling
carried on by the Americans of the settlement of Kaskaskias
situated opposite, which increases daily.”</span><a id="noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href="#note_154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a>

Early in 1796, a petition was sent from Kaskaskia to Congress.
The petitioners desired that they might be permitted
to locate their donation of four hundred acres per family
on Long Prairie, a few miles above Kaskaskia, on the Kaskaskia
River, and that the expense of surveying the land
might be paid by the United States. The act granting
the donation-land had provided for its location between
the Kaskaskia and the Mississippi. This land the petitioners
declared to be private land and some of it was of
poor quality.<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a>

mercantile and legal life of the Illinois settlements, but
they must have been novices in the art of petitioning if
they thought that a petition signed by four men from the
Illinois country, with no sign of their being legally representative,
would be regarded by Congress as an expression
of the opinion of the Northwest Territory. The part of
the petition relating to lands was granted, but the major
part, which related to other subjects, was denied on the
ground that the petitioners probably did not represent
public sentiment.<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href="#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a> During this same year Congress denied
a number of petitions for the right of preëmption in the
Northwest Territory, because such a right would encourage
illegal settling. It was also during this year that the first
sales of public land in the Northwest Territory were
authorized. The land to be sold was in what is now Ohio.
No tract of less than four thousand acres could be purchased.<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="#note_160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a>

In 1800, two hundred and sixty-eight inhabitants of
Illinois, chiefly French, petitioned Congress that Indian
titles to land in the southern part of Illinois might be
extinguished and the land offered for sale; that tracts of
land at the distance of a day's journey from each other,
lying between Vincennes and the Illinois settlements,
might be ceded to such persons as would keep taverns, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that one or two garrisons might be stationed in Illinois.
The petitioners state that the Kaskaskia tribe of Indians
numbered not more than fifteen members and that their
title to land could be easily extinguished; that not enough
land is open to settlement to admit a population sufficient
to support ordinary county establishments; that roads are
much needed, and that many of the inhabitants are crossing
the Mississippi with their slaves. The petition was
not considered.<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href="#note_161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a>

A new factor now appears in the forces affecting Illinois
settlement. The Northwest Territory having advanced to
the second grade of territorial government, in December,
1799, its delegate took his seat in Congress. The step
was an important one for the struggling colony. Before
this time such petitions as were prepared by inhabitants
of the territory for the consideration of Congress
had been subjected to all the vicissitudes of being addressed
to some public officer or of being confided to some member
of Congress who represented a different portion of the
country. Up to this time the public lands could only be
bought in tracts of four thousand acres. Largely through
the influence of the delegate from the Northwest Territory,
a bill was passed which authorized the sale of sections and
half-sections. In consequence, emigration soon began to
flow rapidly into Ohio. Land in Illinois was not yet
offered for sale, but this bill is important because the policy
of offering land in smaller tracts was to continue.<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href="#note_162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">162</span></span></a>

passage of a bill for the division of the Northwest Territory.

a government in the western part as was provided for by
the Ordinance of 1787, was presented. The act for
division was signed by the President on May 7, 1800; it
formed Indiana Territory, with Vincennes as its capital.<a id="noteref_163" name="noteref_163" href="#note_163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a>

The propositions made by a convention of representatives
elected by the citizens of Indiana to prepare petitions
to Congress, near the close of 1802, illustrate the needs of
the time. It was desired that the Indian title to land lying
in Southern Illinois and Southwestern Indiana might be
extinguished and the land sold in smaller tracts and at a
lower price;<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href="#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a>
that a preëmption act might be passed; that
a grant of seminary and school lands might be made; that
land for taverns, twenty miles or less apart, might be
granted along certain specified routes; that donation-lands
might be chosen in separate tracts, instead of in three
specified areas, in order to avoid <span class="tei tei-q">“absolutely useless”</span>
prairies, and also lands claimed by ancient grants; and that
the qualification of a freehold of fifty acres of land, prescribed
for the electors of representatives to the territorial
legislature, might be changed to manhood suffrage, because
the freehold qualification was said to tend <span class="tei tei-q">“to throw too
great a weight in the scale of wealth.”</span> The petition was
considered in committees, but it led to no legislation.<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href="#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a>

None of the above complaints was better founded than
that concerning the restriction of the suffrage, and it is
well to note subsequent proceedings in regard to it. No
qualification less suitable to the time and place could well
have been devised, and this is especially true of the Illinois
portion of the territory, because there unsettled French
claims were to delay the sales of public lands until 1814,
and thus early settlers could neither buy land nor vote
unless they owned it, unless indeed they purchased land
claims from the needy and unbusiness-like French. An
interesting petition of 1807 from the settlement on Richland
Creek,<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href="#note_166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a> for the right of preëmption, throws light upon
conditions then obtaining. The petitioner inclosed a map
of the settlement, with the following explanation: <span class="tei tei-q">“Those
persons whose names are enclosed in said plot, within surveyed
lines, have confirmed and located rights, amounting
to 3,775 acres; ... the residue of the said settlers,
occupying about 6,000 acres of land, have, without any
right, settled upon the public land.”</span> The map shows that
there were eleven owners and twenty-two squatters.<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href="#note_167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a> As
the law then stood, the twenty-two squatters, occupying
more than three-fifths of the land, could not vote. The
eleven land-owners must have secured their land either
under the acts of 1788 or that of 1791, or by the purchase
of French claims, a trade vigorously carried on. In 1808,<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href="#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a>
Congress so far extended the suffrage in Indiana as to
make the ownership of a town lot worth one hundred
dollars an alternative qualification to the possession of a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
freehold of fifty acres. This was in advance of the law in
some of the Eastern states.

After 1802, the land question can not be traced without
reference to the Indian question in Illinois. That question
became important as soon as American occupation was
assured, and it remained important for fifty years after the
Revolution. The desire of the American settlers for land
was directly counter to the desire of the Indians to preserve
their hunting-grounds. Before the close of the eighteenth
century, the list of bloody deeds in Illinois had grown
long.<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href="#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a>
The United States Government appreciated the
gravity of the situation and early made efforts to purchase
the land from the Indians. That part of the treaty of
Greenville, of 1795, which affected Illinois, extinguished
the Indian title to a tract six miles square, at the mouth of
Chicago River; one six miles square, at Peoria; one twelve
miles square, near the mouth of the Illinois River; the
post of Fort Massac, and the land in the possession of the
whites.<a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href="#note_170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a> The treaty of Fort Wayne, in 1803, ceded four
square miles or less, at the salt springs on Saline Creek, and
some land west and southwest from Vincennes. This treaty,
with another made in the following August, ceded three
tracts of land, each one mile square, between Vincennes
and Kaskaskia, to be sites for taverns.<a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a> The treaty of
Vincennes, of August, 1803, ceded land in Illinois bounded

acres near Kaskaskia, and twelve hundred and eighty
acres to be located. This last treaty was made with the
depleted Kaskaskia tribe.<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href="#note_172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a> As the claims of various tribes
overlapped, an Indian treaty rarely signifies that all controversy
in regard to the land ceded is at an end.
Frequently one or more treaties must yet be made with
other tribes, and frequently a tribe refuses to abide by its
agreement.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Previous to 1804, no land was sold in the Northwest
Territory west of the mouth of the Kentucky River. An
act of March 26 of that year provided for the opening of
a land-office at Detroit to sell lands north of Ohio; one at
Vincennes to sell lands in its vicinity ceded by the treaty
of Fort Wayne; and one at Kaskaskia to sell so much of
the land ceded by the treaty of Vincennes (August, 1803)
as was not claimed by any other tribe than those represented
in the cession. The register and the receiver of
public moneys of these respective districts were to be
commissioners to settle private land claims. Evidences of
claims should be filed before January 1, 1805, and after
the adjustment of claims the public lands should be sold
at auction to the highest bidder. Two dollars per acre
was to be the minimum price; no land should be sold
in less than quarter-sections, except fractional portions
caused by irregularities in topography or survey, and lands
unsold after the auction might be sold at private sale.
Although this act provided for the sale of public lands in
Illinois after private claims should have been satisfied, and
directed that such claims should be filed not later than
January 1, 1805, Congress repeatedly extended the time
for the filing of claims, and ten years after the passage of
this act there were still unsatisfied claims.<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a> Not until

retarded immigration of that class which would have made
the most desirable citizens.

Early in 1806, there came to Congress from Illinois a
petition which betrayed the anxiety of the French settlers,
and of the Americans who had bought French claims, lest
the peculiar shape of their holdings should be disturbed by
the orderly system of government surveys. The petitioners
asked that a line might be run from a point north of
Cahokia to an unspecified river south of Kaskaskia, in
such a manner as to include all settlements between the
two points, and that the land so included be exempt from
the mode of survey and terms of sale of other public lands
of the United States. The petition was apparently not
reported upon, but a detailed map of the region referred
to shows that the holdings were left in their bewildering
complexity.<a id="noteref_176" name="noteref_176" href="#note_176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a>

also in investigating land claims of the French and their

choice of buying a French claim with uncertain title or
squatting on government land with the risk of losing
whatever improvement he might make, and often the
added risk of being killed by the suspicious, hostile,
untrustworthy Indians. This was one class of hindrances
to settlement. Another hindrance, next to be noticed, was
the unstable governmental conditions following the anarchy

When St. Clair County was formed, in 1790, it was
made to include all the settlements of the Northwest
Territory to the westward of Vincennes. On account
of its geographical extent it was divided into three judicial
districts, but it could not be made into three separate
counties, because there were not enough men capable of
holding office to furnish the necessary officials. The American
settlers were few and a large proportion of them were
unskilled in matters of government, while the French were
totally unfit to govern. In 1795, St. Clair, when referring

The laws above cited were enacted by the legislature of

from Kaskaskia to St. Clair: <span class="tei tei-q">“During a few weeks past, we
have put into circulation petitions addressed to Governor
Harrison, for a General Assembly, and we have had the
satisfaction to find that about nine-tenths of the inhabitants

The Illinois country early became restive under the
government of Indiana Territory. Much the same causes
for discontent existed as had caused Kentucky to wish to
separate from Virginia, Tennessee from North Carolina,
and the country west of the Alleghanies from the United
States. In each case a frontier minority saw its wishes, if
not its rights, infringed by a more eastern majority. In
each case the eastern people were themselves too weak to
furnish sufficient succor to the struggling West. The
conflict was natural and inevitable. The grave charge
against Governor Harrison, who had large powers of patronage,
was local favoritism. So discontented was Illinois,
that in 1803 it had petitioned for annexation to the territory
of Louisiana when such territory should be formed.<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href="#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a>
Antagonism to the Indiana government became still more
bitter when, in December, 1804, after an election which
was so hurried that an outlying county did not get to vote,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

In the summer of 1805, discontent in Illinois was again
expressed in a memorial to Congress. About three hundred
and fifty inhabitants of the region petitioned for a
division of Indiana Territory, From the Illinois settlements
to the capital, Vincennes, was said to be one hundred
and eighty miles, <span class="tei tei-q">“through a dreary and inhospitable
wilderness, uninhabited, and which during one part of the
year, can scarcely afford water sufficient to sustain nature,
and that of the most indifferent quality, besides presenting
other hardships equally severe, while in another it is part
under water, and in places to the extent of some miles, by
which the road is rendered almost impassable, and the
traveler is not only subjected to the greatest difficulties,
but his life placed in the most imminent danger.”</span> It
resulted that the attendance of Illinois inhabitants upon
either the legislature or the supreme court was fraught
with many inconveniences. Because of the extensive
prairies between Illinois and Vincennes, <span class="tei tei-q">“a communication
between them and the settlements east of that river [the
Wabash] can not in the common course of things, for
centuries yet to come, be supported with the least benefit,
or be of the least moment to either of them.”</span> Illinois
objected to having been precipitated into the second grade
of government. In the election for that purpose, said the
memorialists, only Knox county voted in the affirmative,
and Wayne county did not vote, because the writs of
election arrived too late. Since entering the second grade
the County of Wayne (Michigan) had been struck off. It
was believed that if the prayer for separation should be
granted, the rage for emigration to Louisiana would, in
great measure, cease, the value of public lands in Illinois
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would be increased, and their sale would also be more

governmental support.<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the same time that Congress received the above
memorial, it received a petition from a majority of the
members of the respective houses of the Indiana legislature.
This petition asked that the freehold qualification
for electors be abolished; that Indiana Territory be not
divided, and that the undivided territory be soon made a
state. It was said that the people were too poor to
support a divided government, and that as the general
court met annually in each county it was slight hardship
to the frontier to have the supreme court meet at Vincennes.<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a>

recited in the previous memorial that the wealthy appeal
cases against the Illinois poor to the supreme court at
Vincennes; that landholders on the Wabash are interested
in preventing the population of lands on the Mississippi;
that preëmption is needed, and that it is hoped that the
general government will not pass unnoticed the act of the
last legislature authorizing the importation of slaves into
the territory. It violates the Ordinance of 1787. The

The truth of some of the complaints from Illinois is
apparent. That a land company on the Wabash wished
to hinder settlement on the Mississippi is probably true,
for Matthew Lyon, of Kentucky, said in Congress, in the
winter of 1805-6: <span class="tei tei-q">“The price of lands is various. I

In 1806, a congressional committee reported on the
various memorials and petitions from Illinois, but the
report led to no legislation and thus settled nothing, and
in 1807 petitioning continued.<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> Illinois again petitioned

this petition bearing seventeen signatures. An inclosed

was not acceptable to the people of Illinois. One hundred

which they said that Illinois had paid no taxes and needed
no separate government, also that the committee that
prepared the above petition was not legally chosen. Most
of the signers of the petition were Americans, while most

the representative of Indiana Territory in Congress was
appointed chairman of a committee to consider the expediency
of dividing the territory, and to this committee
petitions both for and against division were referred.
This territorial delegate was in favor of division, and his
committee presented a favorable report, in which the
number of inhabitants of Indiana east of the Wabash was
estimated to be seventeen thousand, and the number west
of the Wabash to be eleven thousand—numbers thought
to be sufficiently large to justify division, and an estimate
which the census of 1810 proves to have been almost
correct. In February, 1809, the bill providing for the
division so ardently desired by Illinois was approved, the
division to take place on the first of the next March.
The western division was to be known as Illinois Territory
and was to have for its eastern boundary a line due north
from Vincennes to the Canadian line.<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204" href="#note_204"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">204</span></span></a> In the debate in

the House of Representatives, preceding the passage of
the bill for division, the arguments in its favor were that
the Wabash was a natural dividing line; that a wide
extent of wilderness intervened between Vincennes and
the western settlements; that the power of the executive
was enervated by the dispersed condition of the settlements;
that to render justice was almost impossible; that
the United States would be more than compensated for
the increased expense by the rise in value of the public
lands. Opponents of the bill declared that the complaints
made by Illinois were common to many parts of the
country; that the number of officers would be needlessly
increased by the proposed division; and that <span class="tei tei-q">“a compliance
with this petition would but serve to foster their
factions, and produce more petitions.”</span> No significant

In addition to the inability to secure land titles on account
of unsettled French claims, to the presence of Indians
and to the discontent with the government of Indiana

These figures show how conspicuously small was the
immigration to Illinois. Enough has already been said
to show some of the reasons for this sluggish settlement.
When, in 1793, Governor St. Clair wrote to Alexander Hamilton,
<span class="tei tei-q">“In compassion to a poor devil banished to another
planet, tell me what is doing in yours, if you can snatch a
moment from the weighty cares of your office,”</span><a id="noteref_206" name="noteref_206" href="#note_206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a> he
doubtless felt that the language was not too strong, and
voiced a feeling of loneliness that was common to the
settlers. Nor was there a lack of land in the East to
make westward movement imperative. Massachusetts was
much opposed to her people emigrating to Ohio, because
she wished them to settle on her own eastern frontier
(Maine), and Vermont and New York had vacant lands.<a id="noteref_207" name="noteref_207" href="#note_207"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">207</span></span></a>

One who settled in Illinois at this period came through
danger to danger, for Indians lurked in the woods and
malaria waited in the lowlands. The journey made by
the immigrants was tedious and difficult, and was often
rendered dangerous by precipitous and rough hills and
swollen streams, if the journey was overland, or by snags,
shoals and rapids, if by water. A large proportion of the
settlers came from Maryland, Virginia, or the Carolinas.
Those from Virginia and Maryland were induced to
emigrate by the glowing descriptions of the Illinois country
given by the soldiers of George Rogers Clark, and
these soldiers sometimes led the first contingent. A
typical Virginia settlement in Illinois was that called New
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Design, located in what is now Monroe county, between
Kaskaskia and Cahokia. Founded about 1786 by a native
of Berkeley county, the settlement received important
additions in 1793, and four years later a party of more
than one hundred and fifty arrived from near the headwaters
of the south branch of the Potomac, this last
contingent led by a Baptist minister, who had organized a
church on a previous visit.<a id="noteref_208" name="noteref_208" href="#note_208"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a> In general, persons Scotch-Irish
by birth were opposed to slavery, as were also the
members of the Quaker church. This caused a considerable
emigration from the Carolinas. Another motive for
people from all sections was that expressed by settlers of
Illinois, in 1806, when they said that they came west in
order to secure <span class="tei tei-q">“such an establishment in land as they
despaired of ever being able to procure in the old
settlements.”</span><a id="noteref_209" name="noteref_209" href="#note_209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a>
We have seen how long deferred was the
fulfillment of their hope of getting a title to the coveted
land. Although the East was not crowded, it is true that
land there was more expensive than that of the same
quality in the West. In 1806, three dollars per acre was
the maximum price in even the settled parts of Indiana
Territory, while fifty dollars per acre had been paid for
choice Kentucky land.<a id="noteref_210" name="noteref_210" href="#note_210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a>

The greater number of immigrants came by water, but
a family too poor to travel thus, or whose starting-point
was not near a navigable stream, could come overland.
Illinois was favored by having a number of large rivers
leading toward it; the Ohio, Kentucky, Cumberland, Tennessee,
and their tributaries were much used by emigrants.

The chief route by land was the Wilderness Road, over
which thousands of the inhabitants of Kentucky had come.
Its existence helps to explain the wonderful growth of
Kentucky—in 1774 the first cabin, in 1790 a population of
73,000. It crossed the mountains at Cumberland Gap,
wound its way by the most convenient course to Crab
Orchard, and was early extended to the Falls of the Ohio
and later to Vincennes and St. Louis. The legislature of
Kentucky provided, in 1795, that the road from Cumberland
Gap to Crab Orchard should be made perfectly commodious
and passable for wagons carrying a weight of one ton, and
appropriated two thousand pounds for the work. Two
years later five hundred dollars were appropriated for the
repair of the road, and the highway was made a turnpike
with prescribed toll, although it did not become such a
road as the word turnpike suggests.<a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href="#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a>

A traveler of 1807 described the river craft of the period.
The smallest kind in use was a simple log canoe. This
was followed by the pirogue, which was a larger kind of
canoe and sufficiently strong and capacious to carry from
twelve to fifteen barrels of salt. Skiffs were built of all
sizes, from five hundred to twenty thousand pounds burden,
and batteaux were the same as the larger skiffs, being
indifferently known by either name. Kentucky boats were
strong frames of an oblong form, varying in size from
twenty to fifty feet in length and from ten to fourteen in
breadth, were sided and roofed, and guided by huge oars.
New Orleans boats resembled Kentucky boats, but were
larger and stronger and had arched roofs. The largest
could carry four hundred and fifty barrels of flour. Keel
boats were generally built from forty to eighty feet in
length and from seven to nine feet in width. The largest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
required one man to steer and two to row in descending
the Ohio, and would carry about one hundred barrels of
salt; but to ascend the stream, at least six or eight men
were required to make any considerable progress. A barge
would carry from four thousand to sixty thousand pounds,
and required four men, besides the helmsman, to descend
the river, while to return with a load from eight to twelve
men were required.<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href="#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a>

Shipments of produce from Illinois were usually made
in flat-bottomed boats of fifteen tons burden. Such a
boat cost about one hundred dollars, the crew of five
men was paid one hundred dollars each, the support
of the crew was reckoned at one hundred dollars, and
insurance at one hundred dollars, thus making a freightage
cost of eight hundred dollars for fifteen tons. The boat
was either set adrift or sold for the price of firewood
at New Orleans. It was estimated that the use of boats
of four hundred and fifty tons burden would save four
dollars per barrel on shipping flour to New Orleans, where
flour had often sold at less than three dollars per barrel,
but such boats were not yet used in the West.<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href="#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a> Canoes

to twenty dollars; small skiffs, five to ten dollars; large
skiffs or batteaux, twenty to fifty dollars; Kentucky and

per foot; keel boats, two dollars and a half to three
dollars per foot; and barges, four to five dollars per

a broken wheel or axle, or a horse lost or stolen by
Indians, caused protracted and vexatious delays. It is
well to notice, also, that to travel a given distance into the

salt at the works for more than fifty cents per bushel, but
by means of silent partners to whom the entire supply

dollars per bushel.<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href="#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a> The commerce of the West suffered
from a lack of vessels going from New Orleans to Atlantic
ports, and as a result corn sold in New Orleans at fifty
cents per bushel in 1805, while in some of the Atlantic
ports it sold for more than two dollars. At the same time
the West had a good crop, and Kentucky alone could have
spared five hundred thousand bushels of corn, if it could

To secure laborers was difficult. A petition of 1796

one dollar per day, exclusive of washing, lodging, and
boarding; that every kind of tradesman was paid from
one dollar and a half to two dollars per day, and that at

Among the early difficulties in the way of settlement,
one of the most persistent was the presence of prairies.
This is by no means far-fetched, although it sounds so to
modern ears. In 1786, Monroe wrote to Jefferson concerning
the Northwest Territory: <span class="tei tei-q">“A great part of the
territory is miserably poor, especially that near Lakes
Michigan and Erie, and that upon the Mississippi and the
Illinois consists of extensive plains which have not had,
from appearances, and will not have, a single bush on
them for ages. The districts, therefore, within which these
fall will never contain a sufficient number of inhabitants
to entitle them to membership in the confederacy.”</span><a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224" href="#note_224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a>
Some of the most fertile of the Illinois prairies were not
settled until far into the nineteenth century. The false
prophets of the early days will be judged less harshly if
we recall that wood was then a necessity, that no railroads
and few roads existed, that wells now in use in prairie
regions are much deeper than the early settlers could dig,
and that the vast quantities of coal under the surface of
Illinois were undiscovered.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As causes for the fact that more than a quarter of a
century after the Revolution, Illinois had a population
estimated at only eleven thousand, may be suggested the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
presence of hostile Indians; the inability of settlers to
secure a title to their land; the unsettled condition of the
slavery question; the great distance from the older portions
of the United States and from any market; the fact
that Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana had vast quantities of
unoccupied land more accessible to emigrants than was
Illinois; the danger and the cost of moving; privation
incident to a scanty population, such as lack of roads,
schools, churches and mills; the existence of large prairies
in Illinois. To remove or mitigate these difficulties was
still the problem of Illinois settlers. On some of them a
beginning had been made before 1809, but none were yet
removed.

Probably nothing affected settlement in Illinois from
1809 to 1818 more profoundly than did changes in
the land question, for during this period Congress passed
important acts relative to land sales, and this was also the
period of the first sales of public lands in the territory. It
seems strange that such sales should have been so long
delayed, yet the settlement of French claims, although
begun by the Governor of the Northwest Territory at an
early day, and continued by commissioners authorized by
Congress and appointed in 1804, was incomplete when
Illinois became a separate territory, and the United States
government adhered to its policy of selling no land in the
territory until the claims were finally adjudicated. When
a list of decisions reported by the commissioners to Congress

seemed probable that the work was nearing completion,
but a final settlement was still delayed, and the long-suffering
Illinois squatters were bitterly disappointed when,
in February, 1812, in accordance with a resolution presented
by the Committee on Public Lands, Congress made
provision for the appointment of a committee to revise the
confirmations made by the Governor years before.<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a> The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
first legislature of Illinois met in the succeeding November,
and adopted a memorial to Congress in which it was
pointed out that the establishment of a land-office in the
territory, several years before, had led to the opinion that
the public land would soon be sold, and that because of
this opinion those who constituted the majority of the
inhabitants of the territory had been induced to settle,
hoping that they would have an opportunity to purchase
land before they should have made such improvements as
would tempt the competition of avaricious speculators.
The fulfillment of this hope having been long deferred,
many squatters had now made valuable improvements
which they were in danger of losing, either at the public
sales of land or through the designs of the few speculators
who had bought from the needy and unbusinesslike
French most of the unlocated claims. For the relief of
the squatters a law was desired that would permit actual
settlers to enter the land on which their improvements
stood, and requiring persons holding unlocated claims to
locate them on unimproved lands lying in the region
designated by Congress for that purpose. It was also
hoped that as Congress had given one hundred acres of
land to each regular soldier, as much would be granted to
each member of the Illinois militia, since the militiaman
had not only fought as bravely as the regular, but had
also furnished his own supplies. If such a donation was
not made it was hoped that a right of preëmption would
be given to the militia, or failing even this, that they might
be given the right, legally, to collect from anyone entering
their land, the value of their improvements.<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href="#note_228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a> In proof of
the fact stated in the memorial, that speculators had bought
many French claims, it may be noted that William Morrison
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
had ninety-two of the claims granted at Kaskaskia,
his affirmed claims comprising more than eighteen thousand
acres, exclusive of a large number of claims measured in
French units, while John Edgar received a satisfactory
report on claims aggregating more than forty thousand
acres, in addition to a number of claims previously affirmed
to him.<a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href="#note_229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few days after preparing the above memorial, the
legislature prepared an address to Congress, in which
reference was made to the arrangement made between
Congress and Ohio by the Act of April 30, 1802, granting
to Ohio two salt springs on condition that the state should
agree not to tax such public lands as should be sold within
her borders, until after five years from the date of sale.
Illinois wished in similar fashion to gain control of the salt
springs on Saline creek. The Illinois delegate in Congress
was instructed that if the bargain could not be made, he
should attempt to secure an appropriation for opening a
road from Shawneetown to the Saline and thence to Kaskaskia.
It was also desired that the Secretary of the
Treasury should authorize the designation of the college
township reserved by the Ordinance of 1787 and by the
Act of 1804, and because <span class="tei tei-q">“labor in this Territory is abundant,
and laborers at this time extremely scarce,”</span> it was
hoped that slaves from Kentucky or elsewhere might be
employed at the salines for a period of not more than
three years, after which they should return to their
masters.<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href="#note_230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a>
Each prayer of this address was granted. The
enabling act and the Illinois constitution ceded the salt
springs to the state and agreed that public lands sold in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Illinois should be exempt from taxation for five years from
date of sale; the Illinois Constitution provided for the
employment of slaves at the salt works; an act provided
for the location of the college township; and in 1816 the
making of the desired road was authorized, although at
the beginning of 1818 the route had been merely surveyed
and mapped.<a id="noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href="#note_231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The memorial which preceded the address was also in
large measure successful. An act of February, 1813,
granted to the squatters in Illinois the right of preëmpting
a quarter section, each, of the lands they occupied, and of
entering the land upon the payment of one-twentieth of
the purchase money, as was then required in private
sales.<a id="noteref_232" name="noteref_232" href="#note_232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a>
This act was of prime importance. For more than thirty
years settlers in Illinois had improved their lands at the
risk of losing them. Since the appointment, in 1804, of
commissioners to settle the French land claims, the settlers
had been expecting the public lands, including those they
occupied, to be offered for sale; thus it was inevitable that
anxiety concerning the right of preëmption should increase
as the settlement of claims neared completion, and contemporaries
record that the inability to secure land titles
seriously retarded settlement;<a id="noteref_233" name="noteref_233" href="#note_233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a> now, however, the granting
of the right of preëmption, before any public lands in
Illinois were offered for sale, ended the long suspense of
the settlers. Years before this, Kentucky, now selling its
public lands at twenty cents per acre, had passed liberal
preëmption laws, and they were repeatedly renewed,<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href="#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a> facts
which increased the anxiety of Illinois.

report of November, 1815, said that the commissioners
hoped to open the land-office at Kaskaskia on May 15,
1816; and finally, in a report on the public lands sold from
October 1, 1815, to September 30, 1816, we find that about
thirty-four thousand acres have been sold at Shawneetown
and somewhat less than thirteen thousand acres at Kaskaskia,
the price at the latter place being precisely the
two dollars per acre which was then the minimum, while
that at Shawneetown was slightly higher,<a id="noteref_238" name="noteref_238" href="#note_238"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">238</span></span></a> presumably due

The long delay in opening the land-offices in Illinois
was fatal to an early settlement of the region, because the
old states had public lands which they offered for sale at
low rates, thus depriving Illinois of a fair chance as a
competitor. In 1779 Kentucky granted to each family
which had settled before January 1, 1778, the right of
preëmption—four hundred acres if no improvement had
been made and one thousand acres if a hut had been
built. The preëmptor, by a law of 1786, was to pay 13<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Indian question was interwoven with the land
question during the territorial period. In 1809 the Indians
relinquished their claim to some small tracts of land lying
near the point where the Wabash ceases to be a state
boundary line.<a id="noteref_254" name="noteref_254" href="#note_254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">254</span></span></a> No more cessions were made until after
the war of 1812. Although the population of Illinois
increased, during the territorial period, from some eleven
thousand to about forty thousand, the increase before the
war was slight, and thus it came about that during the war
the few whites were kept busy defending themselves from
the large and hostile Indian population. So well does the
manner of defence in Illinois illustrate the frontier character
of the region that a sketch of the same may be given.
When, in 1811, the Indians became hostile and murdered a
few whites, the condition of the settlers was precarious in
the extreme. Today the term city would be almost a favor
to a place containing no more inhabitants than were then to
be found in the white settlements in Illinois. Moreover,
few as were the whites, they were dispersed in a long half-oval
extending from a point on the Mississippi near the
present Alton southward to the Ohio, and thence up that
river and the Wabash to a point considerably north of
Vincennes. This fringe of settlement was but a few miles
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wide in some places, while so sparse was the population
near the mouth of the Ohio that the communication
between northern and southern Indians was unchecked.
Carlyle was regarded as the extreme eastern boundary of
settlements to the westward; a fort on Muddy River, near
where the old Fort Massac trace crossed the stream, was
considered as one of the most exposed situations; and
Fort La Motte, on a creek of the same name above Vincennes,
was a far northern point. The exposed outside
was some hundreds of miles long, and the interior and
north were occupied by ten times as many hostile savages
as there were whites in the country, the savages being given
counsel and ammunition by the British garrisons on the
north.<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href="#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a> Under conditions then existing, aid from the United
States could be expected only in the event of dire necessity.
Stout frontiersmen were almost ready to seek refuge in
flight, but no general exodus took place, although in February,
1812, Governor Edwards wrote to the Secretary of
War: <span class="tei tei-q">“The alarms and apprehensions of the people are
becoming so universal, that really I should not be surprised
if we should, in three months, lose more than one-half
of our present population. In places, in my opinion,
entirely out of danger, many are removing. In other
parts, large settlements are about to be totally deserted.
Even in my own neighborhood, several families have
removed, and others are preparing to do so in a week or
two. A few days past, a gentleman of respectability arrived
here from Kentucky, and he informed me that he saw on
the road, in one day, upwards of twenty wagons conveying
families out of this Territory. Every effort to check the
prevalence of such terror seems to be ineffectual, and
although much of it is unreasonably indulged, yet it is very
certain the Territory will very shortly be in considerable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
danger. Its physical force is very inconsiderable, and is
growing weaker, while it presents numerous points of
attack.”</span><a id="noteref_256" name="noteref_256" href="#note_256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the first feeling of fear succeeded a determination to
hold the ground. Before the middle of 1812, Governor
Edwards had established Fort Russell, a few miles northwest
of the present Edwardsville, bringing to this place,
which was to be his headquarters, the cannon which Louis
XIV. had had placed in Fort Chartres;<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href="#note_257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a> and two volunteer
companies had been raised, and had <span class="tei tei-q">“ranged to a great
distance—principally between the Illinois and the Kaskaskia
rivers, and sometimes between the Kaskaskia and
the Wabash—always keeping their line of march never
less than one and sometimes three days' journey outside
of all the settlements”</span><a id="noteref_258" name="noteref_258" href="#note_258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">258</span></span></a>—which incidentally shows what
great unoccupied regions still existed even in the southern
part of Illinois. As the rangers furnished their own supplies,
the two companies went out alternately for periods of
fifteen days. Sometimes the company on duty divided,
one part marching in one direction and the other in the
opposite, in order to produce the greatest possible effect
upon the Indians. Settlers on the frontier—and that
comprised a large proportion of the population—<span class="tei tei-q">“forted
themselves,”</span> as it was then expressed. Where a few
families lived near each other, one of the most substantial
houses was fortified, and here the community staid at
night, and in case of imminent danger in the daytime as
well. Isolated outlying families left their homes and
retired to the nearest fort. Such places of refuge were
numerous and many were the attacks which they successfully
withstood.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Rangers and frontier forts were used with much effect,
but the great dispersion of settlement and the large numbers
of Indians combined to make it wholly impossible to
make such means of defence entirely adequate. In August,
1812, the Governor wrote to the Secretary of War: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
principal settlements of this Territory being on the Mississippi,
are at least one hundred and fifty miles from those
of Indiana, and immense prairies intervene between them.
There can, therefore, be no concert of operations for the
protection of their frontiers and ours.... No troops
of any kind have yet arrived in this Territory, and I think
you may count on hearing of a bloody stroke upon us very
soon. I have been extremely reluctant to send my family
away, but, unless I hear shortly of more assistance than a
few rangers, I shall bury my papers in the ground, send
my family off, and stand my ground as long as possible.”</span><a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href="#note_259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a>
The <span class="tei tei-q">“bloody stroke”</span> predicted by the Governor fell on the
garrison at Fort Dearborn, where Chicago now stands.
Some regular troops were subsequently sent to the territory,
but the war did not lose its frontier character. One
of the most characteristic features was that troops sometimes
set out on a campaign of considerable length, in an
uninhabited region, without any baggage train and practically
without pack horses, the men carrying their provisions
on their horses, and the horses living on wild grass.<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href="#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a>
Unflagging energy was shown by the settlers, several
effective campaigns being carried on, and by the close of
1814 the war was closed in Illinois.<a id="noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href="#note_261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a>

Extinction of Indian titles to land was retarded by the
war and also by the policy of the United States, which was
expressed by Secretary of War Crawford, in 1816, as follows:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“The determination to purchase land only when
demanded for settlement will form the settled policy of
the Government. Experience has sufficiently proven that
our population will spread over any cession, however
extensive, before it can be brought into market, and before
there is any regular and steady demand for settlement,
thereby increasing the difficulty of protection, embarrassing
the Government by broils with the natives, and
rendering the execution of the laws regulating intercourse
with the Indian tribes utterly impracticable.”</span><a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href="#note_262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a> Some
progress, however, was made in extinguishing Indian titles
during the territorial period after the close of the war.
In 1816, several tribes confirmed the cession of 1804 of
land lying south of an east and west line passing through
the southern point of Lake Michigan, and ceded a route
for an Illinois-Michigan canal.<a id="noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href="#note_263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a> At Edwardsville, on September
25, 1818, the Peoria, Kaskaskia, Michigamia, Cahokia,

of this cession would have been immense had it not been
that it was made by weak tribes, while the powerful
Kickapoo still claimed and held all that part of the ceded
tract lying north of the parallel of 39°—a little to the
north of the mouth of the Illinois river. This Kickapoo
claim included the fertile and already famous Sangamon
country, in which the state capital was eventually to be
located, and squatters were pressing hard upon the Indian

became a state.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the territorial period, Illinois gained the long-sought
right of preëmption; the French claims ceased to
retard settlement; some progress was made in the extinction
of Indian titles, and the sale of public land was
begun. The new state was to find the Indian question a
pressing one, and some changes in the land system were
yet desired, but the crucial point was passed.

The act for the division of Indiana Territory provided
that Illinois, during the first stage of its territorial existence,
should have a government similar to that of the
Northwest Territory under the Ordinance of 1787. In
1809 there were in Illinois two distinct and hostile parties,
which had been formed on questions arising in Indiana
Territory before division. It was with sound judgment,
therefore, that the President, going outside of Illinois,
appointed as Governor, Ninian Edwards of Kentucky, a
native of Maryland, who successfully resisted all efforts to
involve him in party quarrels.<a id="noteref_265" name="noteref_265" href="#note_265"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Laws for the government of the territory were to be
chosen by the Governor and the judges from the laws of
the states. The judges were Jesse B. Thomas and William
Sprigg, natives of Maryland, and Alexander Stuart, a
native of Virginia. It is worthy of note that of the twelve
laws chosen before the meeting of the first territorial
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

two from Virginia, one from South Carolina, and one from
Pennsylvania.<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href="#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a> A people practically southern in

Illinois entered the second grade of territorial government
in 1812, electing its first legislature in October.<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href="#note_267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a> In
the preceding May, Congress had passed an act making
radical and most important extensions in the suffrage in
Illinois, over that which had been prescribed by the Ordinance
of 1787. The new provision was: <span class="tei tei-q">“Every free white
male person who shall have attained the age of twenty-one
years, and who shall have paid a county or territorial
tax, and who shall have resided one year in said Territory
previous to any general election, and be at the time of
any such election a resident thereof, shall be entitled to
vote for members of the Legislative Council and House of
Representatives of the said Territory.”</span> Each county was
to elect one member of the Legislative Council, to serve
for four years. The territorial delegate to Congress was
also made elective by the citizens.<a id="noteref_268" name="noteref_268" href="#note_268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a> One has but to consider
what a complete revolution this act brought about to
appreciate its great significance. Previously the Legislative
Council had been appointive by the President of the
United States, from nominees of the territorial House of
Representatives, the nominees being twice the number
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
necessary; the delegate to Congress had not been chosen
by popular vote; and a freehold qualification for the
elective franchise had obtained. Early petitions show how
much the people complained of a landed aristocracy,<a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href="#note_269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a> and
letters written by Governor Edwards early in 1812 show how
well founded was the complaint. No preëmption act had
yet been passed, and of the more than twelve thousand
inhabitants of Illinois some two hundred and twenty possessed
a freehold of fifty acres, thus giving the balance of
power, if the territory should enter the second grade under
the old provision, to one hundred and eleven persons. Nearly
one-third of the entire population lived either near the
Ohio or between it and the Kaskaskia, and among them
there were not more than three or four freeholders, and not
one who possessed two hundred acres—the necessary
qualification for a representative. With no public lands
yet offered for sale, with no right of preëmption, with a
freehold qualification for the suffrage, this law enfranchising
squatters was of prime importance.<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270" href="#note_270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">270</span></span></a>

The rude character of the facilities for transportation is
indicated by the fact that the earlier laws of the territory
deal with ferries only rarely and with bridges not at all,
while as time progresses and population increases, ferries
multiply and bridges begin to be constructed. By 1817-18
the desire for banks and for internal improvements, which
was to be disastrous to the state at a later period, began
to show itself. As examples, the Bank of Cairo and the
Illinois Navigation Company will suffice. Nine men purchased
the low peninsula lying near the junction of the
Ohio and the Mississippi, and were incorporated by <span class="tei tei-q">“An
Act to Incorporate the City and Bank of Cairo.”</span> A site
for a city comprising at least two thousand lots, with
streets eighty feet wide, was to be laid out. The lots
were to be sold at one hundred and fifty dollars each and
were to be not less than one hundred and twenty by sixty-six
feet in size. Of the purchase money, two-thirds
should go into the stock of the Bank of Cairo, and one-third
to a fund to build dykes to keep the city from being
flooded.<a id="noteref_273" name="noteref_273" href="#note_273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">273</span></span></a> Considering the time and the

the Stockholders of the Illinois Navigation Company”</span>
authorized the formation of a company with a
capital of one hundred thousand dollars, for the purpose
of cutting a canal through the peninsula between the Ohio
and the Mississippi. Within twelve years a canal sufficiently
large for the passage of a vessel of twenty tons
burden should be completed. The company was given
the right of eminent domain.<a id="noteref_274" name="noteref_274" href="#note_274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">274</span></span></a> Here again the character
of the project was unsuited to existing conditions. Population
was increasing rapidly at the time these laws were
passed, but they required for their success an increase
much more rapid. They were, however, pleasing to the
settlers and the prospective settlers of the day.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On January 16, 1818, Mr. Pope, of Illinois, was appointed
chairman of a select committee to consider a petition
from the Illinois legislature praying for a state government.
One week later the committee reported a bill to
enable Illinois to form such a government, and to admit
the state into the union. When the enabling act came up
for discussion, Mr. Pope offered the amendment which
changed the northern boundary of Illinois from a line due
west from the southern extremity of Lake Michigan, as
provided by the Ordinance of 1787, to a line running from
that lake to the Mississippi on the parallel of 42° 30'.
<span class="tei tei-q">“The object of this amendment, Mr. Pope said, was to
gain, for the proposed state, a coast on Lake Michigan.
This would offer additional security to the perpetuity of
the union, inasmuch as the state would thereby be connected
with the states of Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
New York, through the lakes. The facility of opening a
canal between Lake Michigan and the Illinois River, said
Mr. Pope, is acknowledged by every one who has visited
the place. Giving to the proposed state the port of Chicago
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(embraced in the proposed limits), will draw its attention
to the opening of the communication between the Illinois
River and that place, and the improvement of that harbor.
It was believed, he said, upon good authority, that the line
of separation between Indiana and Illinois would strike
Lake Michigan south of Chicago, and not pass west of it,
as had been supposed by some geographers....”</span>
Although an avowed violation of the Ordinance of 1787,
the amendment was adopted without division or recorded
debate. Mr. Pope also secured an amendment to the
effect that the state's proportion of the proceeds of the
sales of public lands, instead of being applied to the
making of roads and canals in the state, should be used
in making roads leading to the state, and for the encouragement
of learning, two-fifths being applied to the
former purpose. Pope pointed out that people would
build roads as they needed them, much more readily than
they would supply schools, and that waste school lands in
a new country would produce slight revenue. Subsequent
history of the state justified both statements. The enabling
act met with little opposition and was signed by President
Monroe on April 18, 1818.<a id="noteref_275" name="noteref_275" href="#note_275"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">275</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the provisions of the enabling act was that, in
order to become a state, Illinois must have as many as
forty thousand inhabitants. In anticipation of such a
provision, the territorial legislature had passed a law in
January, 1818, providing that a census of the territory
should be taken between April 1 and June 1. A supplemental
act provided that as a great increase in population
might be expected between June 1 and December, census
takers should continue to take the census in their districts
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of all who should remove into them between June 1 and
December 1. The law as framed gave an opportunity
to count not only immigrants, but to re-count all who
moved from one county to another (such moving being
common), and to count in each successive county persons
passing through the state. There is no reasonable doubt
that at the time the census was taken, the territory had
fewer than forty thousand inhabitants. Dana gives a
census of 1818, in which the number is given as thirty-four
thousand six hundred and sixty-six, and adds:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Another enumeration having been taken a few months
after, the amount of population returned was forty thousand
one hundred and fifty-six, which exceeded the
number entitling the territory to become a state.”</span><a id="noteref_276" name="noteref_276" href="#note_276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">276</span></span></a>

In August, 1818, the Constitution of Illinois was completed.
Its provisions most likely to influence settlement
were those concerning the elective franchise and slavery.
It provided that <span class="tei tei-q">“In all elections, all white male inhabitants
above the age of twenty-one years, having resided in the
state six months next preceding the election, shall enjoy
the right of an elector; but no person shall be entitled to
vote except in the county or district in which he shall
actually reside at the time of the election.”</span> Slaves could
not hereafter be brought into the state, but existing slavery
was not abolished, and existing indentures—and some
were for ninety-nine years—should be carried out, although
future indentures should not run for a longer term than
one year. Male children of slaves or indentured servants
should be free at the age of twenty-one, and females at
eighteen. Slaves from other states could be employed only
at the Saline Creek salt works, and there only until 1825.<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a>

During the congressional debate on the acceptance of the
Illinois Constitution, objection to admitting the state was
made on the ground that the number of inhabitants was
doubtful, and that slavery was not distinctly prohibited,
Tallmadge, of New York, who later wished to restrict
slavery in Missouri, being the chief objector. The state
was admitted, however, and on December 4, 1818, the representatives
and senators from Illinois took their seats in
Congress.<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a>

territorial government to a liberal state

to hasten the change, and the change, in turn, did much

The changes in government and in the land question in
Illinois were typical of changes in other frontier regions,
but although worthy of note as helping to make a more
attractive place for settlement, they are by no means
sufficient to account for the great migration to the westward.
Why that migration took place and how it was
accomplished are interesting and important questions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Emigration from New England resulted largely from
financial and industrial disorganization caused by the close
of the war, and a year of such continued cold weather as
to produce a famine. This movement was interesting,
dramatic, and large in volume, but its influence upon
Illinois was slight, because the tide was stayed to the eastward
of that state.<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href="#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a> Migration from the South was also
large, and it was from this source that most of the immigrants
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to Illinois came. In 1816 there was a severe drought
in eastern North Carolina, and many planters cut their
immature corn for their cattle, while great numbers sold
their property and joined the emigrants.<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href="#note_286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a> Kentucky, still
a favorite place for settlement, was in the midst of a land
boom which reached such proportions as to cause a large
volume of emigration to Illinois, Missouri, and the southwest.
The buyer of Kentucky land was often a neighbor
who wished to enlarge his farm and work on a larger
scale, or some well-to-do immigrant who preferred the
location to a more remote region. Land sold on credit
and at fictitious prices, the seller in turn buying land for
which he frequently could make only the first payment.
Retribution did not come, however, until after 1820, and
for some years it seemed as if Kentucky was to become a
source of population, for it was to Illinois and Missouri,
and to a lesser degree to Alabama, what New England
was to Ohio.<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href="#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a> Probably chief among the reasons for
migration from the South was the increase of slavery, with
the resulting changes in industrial and social conditions.
Early in the century the growing importance of the cotton
crop began to hasten a stratification of opinion which
was determined by physiographic areas. The western
parts of Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, the
northern part of Georgia, and the eastern parts of Kentucky
and Tennessee, respectively, being hilly and less fertile
than the coastal plain, became the center of the southern
anti-slavery sentiment. On the plain settled the wealthy
planters, and later the poorer Germans and Quakers settled
in the uplands. Only when cotton-raising became very
profitable was slavery to intrude upon the latter location.<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href="#note_288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the war the production of cotton in the United
States had been almost constant in amount and less than
in preceding years, but 1815 saw an increase of over forty-two
per cent and 1816 an increase of twenty-four per
cent,<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a> while in the latter year South Carolina, after an
interval of thirteen years, resumed its slavery legislation
by passing the first of a series of acts which show that the
slavery problem was becoming increasingly difficult. Similar
legislation took place in Tennessee, and to a lesser
degree in Kentucky.<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href="#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a> Increased production of cotton was
accompanied by an increase in price, middling upland
cotton selling at New York at 15 cents per pound in 1814,
at 21 cents in 1815, at 29-½ cents in 1816, at 26-½ cents in
1817, and at 34 cents in 1818, while South Carolina sea-island
cotton sold at Charleston in 1816 at 55 cents a
pound.<a id="noteref_291" name="noteref_291" href="#note_291"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">291</span></span></a> An increase in cotton production meant an
increase of the plantation system with its slaves, this meant an
increased demand for large farms, and also a strengthening
of the antagonism between pro-slavery and anti-slavery
parties. Even in 1812, a man who wished to sell, lease, or
rent his manufacturing establishment in the northwestern
part of Virginia, Frederick county, lamented in his advertisement
that <span class="tei tei-q">“some good men of strict moral or religious
principles should object against forming settled abodes in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

the proportion of negroes to whites increased in the
western counties of North Carolina during the decade
1810 to 1820 over the proportion in 1800 to 1810. Conditions
above described naturally led to the emigration of
at least four classes of people: those who were anti-slavery,
those who did not wish to change from small
farming to the plantation system, the poor whites who
found themselves increasingly disgraced and who at the
same time found that their land was in demand, the slave-holder
who wished a large tract of virgin soil. It is very
important to note that these forces were merely beginning
to operate in the time from 1814 to 1818, and that they
did not reach their maximum of influence until after 1830,
yet as the population of Illinois increased less than twenty-eight
thousand from 1810 to 1818, it is altogether probable
that a considerable proportion were influenced by the
causes suggested. It is also true that some pioneers
moved merely from habit, without any well-defined cause.

Although it is true that the first steamboat that passed
down the Ohio and Mississippi made its trip in the winter

Pittsburg, which they reached after a wearisome journey

Shawneetown was a sort of center from which emigrants
radiated to their destinations. It owed much to its location,
being on the main route from the southern states to
St. Louis and what was then called the Missouri, and being
also the port for the salt works on Saline Creek. It was
the seat of a land-office. The town thus had a business
which was out of all proportion to the number of its permanent
inhabitants. In 1817 it consisted of but about
thirty log houses, a log bank, and a land-office. When a
certain traveler came to the place from the South, in 1818,
he found the number of wagons, horses, and passengers
waiting to cross the Ohio, on the ferry, so great that he
had to wait <span class="tei tei-q">“a great part of the morning”</span> for his turn.<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href="#note_301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a>

There is much truth in the remarks made by a German
traveler in 1818-19. He said: <span class="tei tei-q">“The State of Illinois is
from one thousand to twelve hundred miles distant from
the sea ports. The journey thither is often as costly and
tedious, for a man with a family, as the sea passage. Any
father of a family, unless he is well-to-do, can certainly
count on being impoverished upon his arrival in Illinois.
At Williamsport, on the Susquehanna, I found a Swiss,
who, with his wife and ten children, had spent one thousand
French crown-dollars for their journey. In the village of
Williamsport, an old German schoolmaster, who seems to
have been formerly a merchant in Nassau, told me that
the passage of himself and family had cost thirteen hundred
dollars. For an adult the fare is seventy-five dollars—one
dollar is equal to one thaler, ten groschen, Prussian—for
children under twelve years, half so much, for children
of two years, one-fourth so much, and only babes in
arms go free.”</span><a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href="#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a>

It can now be understood why people emigrated to the
West, and also why many went overland. A family too
poor to go by water could go in a buggy or wagon, and if
poorer still they might walk, as many actually did. The
immigration to Illinois, which was but a small fraction of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the great westward movement, was still largely southern
in origin, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, and even New York
still staying, in large measure, the tide from New England.
In New England it was the <span class="tei tei-q">“Ohio fever”</span> and not the
Illinois fever which carried away the people, and the
designation is geographically correct. The men prominent
in Illinois politics at the close of the territorial period, and
at the beginning of the state period, were natives of southern
states, a fact hardly conceivable if New England had
been largely represented in Illinois. Then, too, the natural
routes from the South led to, or near to, Illinois, the great
road from the South crossing the Ohio River at Shawneetown,
and the Kentucky and Cumberland rivers being
natural water routes. Another fact to be noticed is that
much of the emigration was of relatives and friends to
join those who had gone before, and as Virginia, Maryland,
Kentucky, Tennessee, the Carolinas, and even Georgia,
had furnished a large number of early settlers to Illinois,
this was a powerful inducement to continued emigration
from the same sources. Similarly Ohio and Michigan had
early received settlers from the East.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Immigration to Illinois was not large in comparison to
that to neighboring states or territories. Indians still held
the greater part of Illinois, and the inconveniences incident
to frontier life were more pronounced as the distance
from the East increased. Pro-slavery men, and anti-slavery
men as well, were still in doubt as to the ultimate
fate of slavery in Illinois. This had a deterrent effect
upon immigration.

Most of the manufactured articles were consumed within

but a large proportion of the supply was used as a substitute
for sugar, another substitute much used being wild
honey. A certain Smith's Prairie was celebrated for the
numerous plum and crabapple orchards that grew around
its borders. The large red and yellow plums grew there
in such abundance that people would come from long
distances and haul them away by the wagon-loads, and
would preserve them with honey or maple sugar, which
was the only sweetening they had in pioneer times.<a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310" href="#note_310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a>

almost unknown. Furs, wild honey, and other commodities
of Illinois, as well as lead from the Missouri mines, were
carried down and exchanged for groceries, cloth, and other
articles of a large value and small bulk. As a natural
consequence of having to be transported up stream, goods

Towards the close of the period land could easily
be secured by government entry. The fertility of the
land was such as must have been new to those immigrants

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
suggested what was eventually to be the solution of the

be some time before these vast prairies can be
settled, owing to the inconvenience attending the want of
timber. I know of no way, unless the plan is adopted of
ditching and hedging, and the building of brick houses,
and substituting the stone coal for fuel. It seems as if the
bountiful hand of nature, where it has withheld one gift has
always furnished another; for instance, where there is a

Really good roads were entirely lacking. Most of the
settlements were connected by roads that were practicable
at most seasons for packers and travelers on horseback,
but in times of flood the suspension of travel by land was
practically complete. A post-road had been established
between Vincennes and Cahokia in 1805, and in 1810 a
route was established from Vincennes, by way of Kaskaskia,
Prairie du Rocher, and Cahokia, to St. Louis. At this
time and place, however, a post-route does not necessarily
imply anything more than a bridle-path. Mail was received

part of the then Territory of Illinois, and settled in
Madison County, twenty-five miles east of St. Louis, which
town then contained about five thousand inhabitants. The
surrounding country, however, was quite sparsely settled,
and destitute of any energy or enterprise among the
people; their labors and attention being chiefly confined to
the hunting of game, which then abounded, and tilling a
small patch of corn for bread, relying on game for the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
remaining supplies of the table. The inhabitants were of
the most generous and hospitable character, and were
principally from the southern states; harmony and the
utmost good feeling prevailed throughout the country.”</span><a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href="#note_323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a>
Naturally this description was not of universal application,
but the source of the population and the reasons for
removing from the old homes make it probable that it was
widely appropriate.

If it was difficult for an emigrant to reach Illinois, and
if, after reaching it, he was inconvenienced by the poor
facilities for commerce, the bad roads, the infrequency of
mails, the scarcity of schools and churches, he at least
found it easy to obtain a living, and to some of the immigrants
of the territorial period it was worth something not
to starve, even though living was reduced to its lowest
terms. The poorest immigrant had access to land on the
borders of settlement, because the laws against squatting
were not enforced. This same class could procure game
in abundance, while maple sugar, wild honey, persimmons,
crabapples, nuts, pawpaws, wild grapes, wild plums, fish,
mushrooms, <span class="tei tei-q">“greens,”</span> berries of several kinds, and other
palatable natural products known to the Illinois frontiersman,
were to be had in most, if not all, of the localities
then settled. Hogs fattened on the mast. Log houses
could be built without nails. The problem of clothing
was probably more difficult at first than that of food, but
although clothing could not be picked up in the woods,
the materials for making it could be grown in the fields.
Spinning, and the processes necessarily preceding and
following it, involved a certain amount of labor. Taxes
were not high, nor were tax laws rigidly enforced. It is
thus easy to understand the reasoning that may have led
a large proportion of the immigrants during this period to
leave their old homes.

One of the most important cessions of land in Illinois
ever made by the Indians was that made by the
Kickapoo in 1819, of the vast region lying north of the
parallel of 39—a little north of the mouth of the Illinois
River, and southeast of the Illinois River.<a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href="#note_324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a> Settlement
had been crowding hard upon this region and many
squatters anxiously awaited the survey and sale of the
land, especially of that in the famous Sangamon country.
In northern Illinois settlement was still retarded by the
presence of Indians. In 1825, the Menominee, Kaskaskia,
Sauk and Fox, Potawatomi, and Chippewa tribes claimed
over 5,314,000 acres of land in Illinois,<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a> and there was a

Kaskaskia, and Winnebago claimed land in the state,
although only about 6000 of the more than 25,000 members
of these tribes resided in the state. The eight
members of the Kaskaskia tribe held a small reservation
near the Kaskaskia River. Of the twenty-two hundred
members of the Kickapoo tribe, which had relinquished all
claim to land east of the Mississippi, about two hundred
still lived on the Mackinaw River, but they were expected
to move in a few weeks.<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href="#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a>

The balances unpaid by purchasers of public lands steadily
increased from 1813 to 1819 until on September 30, 1819,
there was due from purchasers of land in the area of the old Northwest
Territory nearly ten million dollars.<a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href="#note_336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a> An
increase would have resulted merely from an increased sale
of public lands under the credit system, but it is also true
that the difficulty of collecting the unpaid balances became
so great that the government at last abolished the credit
system, by the act of April 24, 1820. The act provided
that after July 1, 1820, no credit whatever should be given
to the purchasers of public lands; that land might be sold
in either sections, half-sections, quarter-sections, or eighth-sections;
that the minimum price should be reduced from
two dollars to one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre;
and that reverted lands should be offered at auction before
being offered at private sale.<a id="noteref_337" name="noteref_337" href="#note_337"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">337</span></span></a> At least two of the provisions
of this act had long been desired by Illinois in
common with other frontier regions: the reduction of the
minimum price and the sale in smaller tracts. Under the
new law a man with one hundred dollars could buy eighty
acres of land, while previously the same man would have
had to pay eighty of his one hundred dollars as the first
payment on one hundred and sixty acres, the smallest tract
then sold. The great danger had been that the second,
third, and fourth payments could not be made. In Illinois,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before July 1, 1820, there had been sold 1,593,247.53 acres

As more and more land was opened to settlement, a
new difficulty arose and became increasingly troublesome.
All public land was to be entered at the same minimum
price, and as a natural result, the poorest land was not taken
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
up and settlement became widely dispersed on the best
tracts of land. In December, 1824, the Illinois legislature
sent a memorial to Congress portraying the evils of sparse
settlement, and asking that land that had been offered for
sale for five years or more might be sold at fifty cents per
acre. Better roads, better markets, and better institutions
were expected to result from such sales.<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a> Two years later,
another memorial was sent. This asked that land be
offered for sale at prices graduated according to the quality
of the land, suggested that the poorest land might well
be donated to settlers, and declared that settlement was
retarded by the high minimum price of land.<a id="noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href="#note_343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a> Governor
Ninian Edwards pointed out that in 1790, Hamilton had

per acre, which <span class="tei tei-q">“was the price at which Kentucky, long

Public Lands recommended that public lands unsold at
public sale be first offered at one dollar per acre, and if
still unsold, that the price be reduced twenty-five cents per
acre each two years until sold or reduced to twenty-five
cents per acre; that eighty-acre homestead claims be given
to such persons as would cultivate and occupy them for five
years; and that lands unsold at twenty-five cents per acre
be ceded to the states in which they lay, upon payment of
the cost of survey and twenty-five cents per acre. At this
time, there was in Illinois 1,403,482 acres surveyed and sold;
19,684,186 acres surveyed and unsold, of the 39,000,000
acres estimated to be in the State.<a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345" href="#note_345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">345</span></span></a> Still another memorial
from the legislature was sent to Congress in 1829. It
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pointed out, in strong terms, the inconvenience arising from
the high price at which public land was offered for sale.
Unsold public land could neither be taxed nor legally
settled. It was stated that of the forty millions of acres
in Illinois, little over one and one-half millions had been
sold at public sales. A granting of the right of preemption,
which implies the presence in the state of
squatters, is suggested.<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346" href="#note_346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The implication of the presence of squatters was well
founded. When Peter Cartwright, in 1823, visited a settlement
in the Sangamon country, he found it a community
of squatters, on land which had been surveyed, but was
not yet offered for sale. Money was hoarded up to enter
land when Congress should order sales. Cartwright paid
a squatter two hundred dollars for his improvement and
his claim, bought some stock, and rented out the place, to
which he was to remove from Kentucky the following
year.<a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347" href="#note_347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a> This squatting on surveyed land, and even on
unsurveyed land, was a regular procedure. It added much
to the difficulty of governing the state—hence the memorials
to Congress, and hence the great significance to
Illinois of an act of May 29, 1830, which gave to all
settlers who had cultivated land in 1829 the right to preempt
not more than one hundred and sixty acres.<a id="noteref_348" name="noteref_348" href="#note_348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a> This
law was of general application. Even now the Illinois
legislature sent another petition concerning preemption to
Congress, because one of the provisions of the act of May,
1830, was that the plat of survey should have been filed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the land-office, and this provision debarred about one
thousand Illinois squatters from the benefit of the act. A
modification in their favor was desired.<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a>

The land claims of the ancient settlers, as they are
called in government documents, continued to occupy the
attention of Congress, in a desultory way, throughout the
period, but their influence upon settlement had practically
ceased with the opening of the public land-offices.<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href="#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a>

Among the obstacles to settlement was the holding of
land by non-residents. Such lands were subject to a triple
tax in case of delinquency, and when sold for taxes and
costs frequently did not bring enough for that purpose, in
which event they reverted to the state and the state paid
the costs. Redemption, although possible, was rare.<a id="noteref_351" name="noteref_351" href="#note_351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a> In
1823, about nine thousand quarter-sections of land in the

Illinois early understood that an Illinois-Michigan canal
would help to people her northern lands. This led to
many efforts to secure such a waterway. In 1819 a favorable
topographical report concerning the route for the
proposed canal was made,<a id="noteref_356" name="noteref_356" href="#note_356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a> and in 1822 the state was

grant of the townships through which the canal would
pass. A committee report of March, 1826, which was
almost identical with another presented in February, 1825,
pointed out that the cost of transporting a ton of merchandise
from Philadelphia, New York, or Baltimore was
about ninety dollars, and required from twenty to twenty-two
days. The probable cost by the proposed canal, the
Lakes, and the Erie Canal, from St. Louis to New York
was from sixty-three to sixty-five dollars per ton, and the
time from twelve to fifteen days. The canal would bind
Illinois and Missouri to the North.<a id="noteref_358" name="noteref_358" href="#note_358"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">358</span></span></a> Congress received a
memorial from the legislature on the same subject in
January, 1827, requesting the grant of <span class="tei tei-q">“two entire townships,

that markets at New Orleans fluctuated because of speculators,
and that grain and goods sent from the West to the
Atlantic ports by way of New Orleans was exposed to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The canal commissioners promptly platted the
original town of Chicago and sold lots at from twenty to
eighty dollars each, but no immediate settlement followed
the land sale, and Chicago remained for some years longer
an Indian town. The prospect of having a canal doubtless
had some influence upon settlement, but at the close of
1830 the actual construction of the canal was still a thing
of the future. By the close of 1828, Congress had donated
to Illinois, for various purposes, chiefly for schools and
internal improvements, 1,346,000 acres.<a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361" href="#note_361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a>

The salt springs had been vested in the state of Illinois
with the provision that no part of the reservations should
be sold. Large reservations were made at the Saline River
salt works and at the Vermilion saline near Danville, the
object being to reserve a supply of wood for the making
of salt. Upon the discovery of coal near the springs the
state was permitted to sell not more than thirty thousand
acres of the Saline River reservation.<a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362" href="#note_362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a>

one hundred lots, one-half for the support of the gospel,

its incorporation in 1821. A similar donation made by

indicated by the figures for 1828 and 1829. The Indian
barrier was being pushed back, and the Sangamon country,
with its land-office at Springfield, was a favorite place for
settlement. The rapid increase in the amount of land
sold is also striking. As the third decade of the century
closed Indiana was the favorite place for frontier settlement.
The sales of public lands in Ohio were diminishing.
A prophetic glance would have seen that as the ever-shifting
frontier passed westward Illinois was to overtake
and then to far surpass Indiana in number of settlers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The period from 1818 to 1830 saw the Indian title to a
great fertile tract of land in Illinois extinguished, the price
of all public lands lowered and the land offered for sale in
smaller tracts, the right of preemption granted to squatters
who had settled before 1830, considerable grants of land
made to the state for internal improvements, the great salt
spring reservations reduced. These changes did much to
make Illinois a more attractive place for settlement.
When a committee of workingmen in Wheeling, Virginia,
made a report, in October, 1830, on a method of escaping
from the ills of workingmen, they presented an elaborate
plan for buying land and forming a colony in Illinois.<a id="noteref_368" name="noteref_368" href="#note_368"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">368</span></span></a>
The experience of the squatter who settled with four or
five sows for breeders and in four years or less drove forty-two
fat hogs to market and sold them for $135, with which
he bought eighty acres of land and paid his debts, was not
a rare one.<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href="#note_369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">369</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As 1830 closed there were still problems connected with
the land to solve. The Indian question persisted, non-resident
landholders were troublesome, and the state
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would still seek grants for internal improvements, but none
of these was to be long a serious impediment to settlement.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In some respects the character of the state government
of Illinois shows the character of the settlers. The nativity
of the governors and the congressmen of the state indicates
that the South was the origin of a majority of the population.
Before the end of 1830 there had been no northern-born
representative of the state in the national House of
Representatives; the first northern-born senator was chosen
in the last month of 1825, and the first northern governor
in 1830.<a id="noteref_370" name="noteref_370" href="#note_370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">370</span></span></a>
Pierre Menard, a French Canadian, the first
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
lieutenant-governor, came to Illinois in 1790, and can not
fairly be cited as a type of the French descendants of the
first white settlers of Illinois.<a id="noteref_371" name="noteref_371" href="#note_371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">371</span></span></a> As a matter of fact, the
French element was not a political factor of importance.
Nor is it true that all southerners were pro-slavery, for the
most noted anti-slavery governor of Illinois, and her governor
during the Civil War, were from the South, while
her first northern senator was pro-slavery. The great
influx of immigrants from New England and the rest of
the North did not come until after 1830. It was retarded,
after the opening of the Erie Canal (1825), by the Winnebago
and Black Hawk wars, and did not reach its height
until the latter war had closed and the Indian claims to
land in northern Illinois had been extinguished. Immigration
from the northern states increased proportionally,
however, after 1820.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Illinois men in Congress give a number of indications of
the feeling of the people on questions having a more or
less intimate relation to settlement. Constant and insistent
demands for more land-offices, more post-roads, more
pensions, donations of land for poor settlers, grants of
land for internal improvements, the right of preëmption
for squatters, and the reduction of the price of public
lands show that the frontier was in favor of a liberal governmental
expenditure.<a id="noteref_372" name="noteref_372" href="#note_372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">372</span></span></a> Congressmen from Illinois, without
exception, favored the tariff bills of 1824 and 1828.<a id="noteref_373" name="noteref_373" href="#note_373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">373</span></span></a>
In 1828, the only senator from Illinois who voted on the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
question, voted for the bill abolishing imprisonment for
debt on processes issuing from a United States court.<a id="noteref_374" name="noteref_374" href="#note_374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">374</span></span></a>
Since Illinois early abolished such imprisonment, it is
interesting to note that three hundred and thirty-eight
persons were committed to the Essex county jail in New
Jersey, for debt, in the year ending April 1, 1823, of whom
one hundred and forty-one were in close confinement.
The aggregate of debt was fifty-five thousand dollars.<a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375" href="#note_375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Within the state one of the phenomena which has characterized
frontier regions appeared about the year 1821.
A desperate gang of immigrants had robbed and plundered
until, after a most notable robbery, <span class="tei tei-q">“a public meeting was
held, and among other things, a company was formed,
consisting of ten law-abiding men of well-known courage,
who bound themselves together, under the name of the
Regulators of the Valley, to rid the country of horse
thieves and robbers.... A regular constitution was
drawn up and subscribed to.”</span> After the leader of the
desperadoes had been killed the remainder fled.<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href="#note_376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a> A frontier
condition is indicated also by the fact that when
Sangamon county was formed, on January 30, 1821, a
special law provided that housekeepers in the county
should perform the duties and receive the privileges of
freeholders. The same provision was made for Morgan
county two years later. As land sales in the Sangamon
country, in which these counties lay, did not begin until
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
November, 1823, these laws probably resulted from the
formation of counties whose entire population consisted of
squatters.<a id="noteref_377" name="noteref_377" href="#note_377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">377</span></span></a>

Irish, and presumably all other aliens, could vote at all
elections. An election law of this year provided that
voting should be by the voter's approaching the bar, in
the election room, and naming in an audible voice the
persons for whom he voted, or, if the voter preferred, by
delivering to the judges a ballot which should be read
aloud by them, the alternative being for the benefit of
illiterate voters. Voting had previously been by ballot.<a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379" href="#note_379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although frontier conditions obtained, there were evidences
of their gradual amelioration. A law of 1823
provided that counterfeiting, which, in the territorial period,
had been punishable by death, should be punished by a
fine of not more than one thousand dollars, whipping with
not fewer than one hundred nor more than two hundred
lashes, imprisonment for not more than twelve months,
and being rendered forever infamous.<a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href="#note_380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">380</span></span></a> The state established
a system of common schools to be supported, in
part, by the state, in 1825; but in 1829 the sections of
the act which provided that two per cent of all money
received into the state treasury, and five-sixths of the
interest of the school fund, should be for the support of
public schools, were repealed,<a id="noteref_381" name="noteref_381" href="#note_381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">381</span></span></a> taxation for such a purpose

mechanic's lien law, passed in 1825, provided that in case
of a contract between a landowner and a mechanic, the
mechanic should have a lien upon the product of his labor
for three months, after which the lien lapsed unless suit
had been commenced. Three years later an unsuccessful
attempt to secure such a law was made in New York.<a id="noteref_382" name="noteref_382" href="#note_382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">382</span></span></a>

Governor Cass' protection of Galena during the Winnebago
War of 1827 may have been influenced by its
uncertain governmental status. In 1828 miners in what is
now southwestern Wisconsin voted for members of Congress
from Illinois, and in 1829 Galena was enumerated
among the thriving towns of Huron or Ouisconsin Territory.
November 29, 1828, one hundred and eighty-seven
inhabitants of Galena and vicinity sent a memorial to
Congress asking that a separate territory be formed, the
territory to be bounded on the south by a line drawn due
west from the southern point of Lake Michigan to the
Mississippi, and by the northern boundary of Missouri.
The memorial began: <span class="tei tei-q">“The undersigned, inhabitants of
that portion of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Territory Northwest of the Ohio,’</span> lying
north of a due east and west line drawn through the
southernmost end of Lake Michigan, and west of that
lake to the British possessions, comprehending the mining
district, more generally known as the Fever River Lead
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Mines.”</span> The petitioners referred to the violation of the
Ordinance of 1787, and also stated that they were subject
to two separate governments, each some hundreds of miles
from them, and each unacquainted with their needs. The
petition was read and tabled.<a id="noteref_385" name="noteref_385" href="#note_385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a> It is true that the situation
of Galena was peculiarly difficult. No mail could be
carried along the rude trail from Peoria to Galena during
the wet season, and when the Illinois legislature, seeking
to give relief, passed a bill for laying out a road between
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Illinois settlements and Galena,”</span> it was vetoed by the
governor and council because the road would pass through
lands of the United States and of the Indians. When
the river was frozen provisions were very high, and mail
was sent forward from Fort Edwards once a month. These
conditions were more aggravating as the number of inhabitants
increased, and in 1827, notwithstanding the trouble
with the Winnebago Indians, there were about four thousand
men at Galena, and they mined about fifteen times
as much lead as had been mined in 1823. In January,
1828, a congressional committee reported favorably on a
proposition to open a road to Galena.<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href="#note_386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a> In a letter written
one year later by the delegate from Michigan Territory, to
the committee on territories, the suggestion is made that
a new territory, to be called Huron, should be formed,
because the region at Galena was said to have received
hundreds of settlers during the preceding summer and
to have at the time of writing ten thousand or more,
and government in the lead region could not be properly
carried on from Detroit, which was eight hundred or one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thousand miles distant, by the routes commonly traveled.
The legislature of Michigan was said to be compelled to
meet in the summer in order to enable delegates to attend
and that was the busy time at the mines.<a id="noteref_387" name="noteref_387" href="#note_387"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">387</span></span></a> A congressional
act of February, 1829, provided for the laying out of a
village at Galena. The plat was not to exceed one section
of land, no lot was to be larger than one-fourth of an
acre, unimproved lots were to be sold at not less than five
dollars, improved lots were to be graded, without reference

Another mode of relief, which the inhabitants were working
out for themselves, is described in a Galena paper of
September 14, 1829: <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Soulard's wagon and mule
team returned, a few days since, from Chicago, near the
southernmost bend of Lake Michigan; to which place it
had been taken across the country, with a load of lead.
This is the first wagon that has ever passed from the Mississippi
River to Chicago. The route taken from the
mines was, to Ogee's ferry, on Rock River, eighty miles;
thence an east course sixty miles, to the Missionary establishment
on the Fox River of the Illinois; and thence a
north-easterly course sixty miles to Chicago, as travelled,
two hundred miles. The wagon was loaded with one ton
and a half of lead. The trip out was performed in eleven,
and the return trip in eight days. The lead was taken, by
water, from Chicago to Detroit. Should a road be surveyed
and marked, on the best ground, and the shortest
distance, a trip could be performed in much less time.
And if salt could be obtained at Chicago, from the New

As the life history of an individual recapitulates the
history of the development of a species, so does the history
of Galena, in respect to the difficulties of its early settlers,
recapitulate the history of the several parts of the United
States in their early days. As Illinois had sent petitions
for relief to the governments of the Northwest Territory,
of Indiana Territory, and of the United States, so did
Galena send similar petitions to the governments of Illinois,
of Michigan Territory, and of the United States. In each
case the prayers of the petitioners were but partially
granted. In each case the difficulties from Indians, lack of
facilities for commerce, distance from the seat of government,
inability to secure lands, were gradually mitigated
until the steady onward sweep of settlement engulfed the
outlying region and it ceased to be the frontier, and
turned its energies to other questions—different, although
probably as difficult. Galena, even at the close of 1830,
was a frontier region on the outskirts of Illinois settlement.

Transportation was long a difficult problem, although it
became gradually less so. Travel by either water or land
was slow and difficult. When a party of about one hundred
men, conducted by Colonel R. M. Johnson, went, in
six or eight boats, from St. Louis to the site of the present
Galena, in 1819, to make an arrangement with the Indians
which would permit the whites to mine lead, the upward
voyage occupied some twenty days.<a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href="#note_390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a> Doubtless the journey

Illinois, in 1819, was typical of that of the better class of
immigrants. At the Virginia homestead, slaves, horses
and wagons were prepared for the long journey. A trusty
slave was put in charge of the caravan of emigrant wagons
and started out on the long journey over the Alleghanies
to Brownsville, Pennsylvania. Mr. Coles started a few
days later, overtook the party one day's journey from
Brownsville, and upon arriving at that place bought two
flat-bottomed boats, upon which negroes, horses and
wagons, with their owner, were embarked. The drunken
pilot was discharged at Pittsburg, and Coles acted as captain
and pilot on the voyage of some six hundred miles
down the Ohio to a point below Louisville, whence, the
boats being sold, the journey was continued by land to
Edwardsville, Illinois.<a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391" href="#note_391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">391</span></span></a>

of three of them, started from Casey County, Kentucky,
for Illinois.... The first three were young unmarried
men, the last three had their wives and children with them.
They came in an old-fashioned Tennessee wagon, that
resembled a flat-boat on wheels. The younger readers of
this sketch can form but a faint idea of the curious and
awkward appearance of one of these old fashioned wagons,
covered over with white sheeting, the front and rear bows
set at an angle of forty-five degrees to correspond with
the ends of the body, and then the enormous quantity of
freight that could be stowed away in the hole would
astonish even a modern omnibus driver! Women, children,
beds, buckets, tubs, old fashioned chairs, including all the
household furniture usually used by our log-cabin ancestors;
a chicken coop, with <span class="tei tei-q">‘two or three hens and a jolly
rooster for a start,’</span> tied on behind, while, under the wagon,
trotted a full-blood, long-eared hound, fastened by a short
rope to the hind axle. Without much effort on your part,
you can, in imagination, see this party on the road, one of
the men in the saddle on the near horse, driving; the other
two, perhaps on horseback, slowly plodding along in the
rear of the wagon, while the boys <span class="tei tei-q">‘walked ahead,’</span> with

Within the state changes in facilities for transportation

In February, 1821, the legislature authorized the building
of a turnpike road, one hundred feet wide, from the Mississippi,
opposite St. Louis, across the American Bottom to
the Bluffs. Toll was to be regulated by the county commissioners,
but it must be not less than twelve and one-half
cents for a man and horse, twenty-five cents for a one-horse
wagon or carriage, six and one-fourth cents for each
wheel and each horse of other wagons and carriages, six
and one-fourth cents for each single horse or head of
cattle, and two cents for each hog or sheep. If at any

Illinois, established a direct path or track from Iroquois
Post to Danville. In 1824 this path, which was known as
<span class="tei tei-q">“Hubbard's Trail,”</span> was extended northward to Chicago,
and southward to a point about one hundred and fifty

Springfield was the northern terminus of the mail route

and St. Louis thrice a week; between Maysville and St.
Louis, and between Belleville and St. Charles twice a
week. No point in Illinois, not on one of these routes,

of Indiana and Illinois petitioned Congress for an
appropriation to improve the mail route from Louisville,
Kentucky, to St. Louis, Missouri. The length of that part
of the route which lay between Vincennes and St. Louis
was one hundred and sixty miles, but a more direct route,
recently surveyed by authority of the legislature of Illinois,
reduced the distance to one hundred and forty-five miles.
The distance between Vincennes and St. Louis was made
up of about one-fourth of timber land and three-fourths
of prairies, from five to twenty miles across. <span class="tei tei-q">“The settlements
are therefore scattered, and far between, and confined
to the vicinity of the timbered land. More than nineteen-twentieths
of the land, over which the road passes, is the

a proper state of repair, is beyond the capacity of the
people who reside upon it.”</span> Another writer says of the

Galena remained much isolated. A man who had
horses and cattle, purchased in southern Illinois and driven
to Galena, by way of Springfield and Peoria, in 1823, says
that there was no settlement between Peoria and Fever
River. A year before, a traveler who went from St. Louis

About 1827 it was common for men to go with teams of
four yoke of oxen, and strong canvas-covered wagons
from southern Illinois to the lead regions. In those
regions they spent the summer in hauling from the mines
to the furnaces or from the furnaces to the place of shipment,
usually Galena, and taking back to the mines a load
of supplies. In the fall the teamsters returned to their
homes, sometimes, in the early days, taking a load of lead
to St. Louis. These men lived in their wagons, and cooked
their own food. The oxen lived by browsing at night.<a id="noteref_414" name="noteref_414" href="#note_414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">414</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
$0.50; Wheeling to Cincinnati, $0.40; Wheeling to
Louisville, $0.45; Cincinnati to Louisville, $0.12-½; in the
reverse direction rates were the same, except that the rate
from Louisville to Cincinnati was $0.16. Freight on pork,
from Cincinnati to Louisville was $0.20 per barrel, and on
flour and light (probably meaning empty) barrels, $0.15
per barrel. The schedule rates were not, however, generally
adhered to, many boats carrying freight at from 2-½
to 5 cents lower than the quoted rate.<a id="noteref_428" name="noteref_428" href="#note_428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">428</span></span></a> At this time there
were 213 steamboats in use in western waters—an increase
of about three-fold since 1820.<a id="noteref_429" name="noteref_429" href="#note_429"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">429</span></span></a> Improved transportation
caused a better market price for produce in the West. In
1819, at Cincinnati, flour sold at $1.37-½ per barrel, corn
at from $0.10 to $0.12 per bushel, and pork at $0.10-½
per pound,<a id="noteref_430" name="noteref_430" href="#note_430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">430</span></span></a> while in 1830, in the same market, flour from
wagons sold at $2.65 per barrel, or from store at $3.00;
corn at $0.18 to $0.20, and pork at $0.05 per pound ($10.00
to $10.50 per barrel).<a id="noteref_431" name="noteref_431" href="#note_431"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">431</span></span></a> The influence of improved transportation
on emigration is obvious. In regard to steamboat
navigation it should be noted that in 1817 rates up-stream
were more than three times as high as rates down-stream,
in 1823 the former were less than twice the latter,
and in 1830 the two were about equal. During the same
period the time of up-stream passage was diminished
more than one-half. Steamboats had not driven out the
ruder crafts, but more and more use was being made of the
more expeditious means of transportation, and its effect on
the future economic activity of the West could already be
seen.

Nashville, Tennessee. At the same time corn sold for
from $0.08 to $0.10 in Illinois, and for $1.75 to $2.00 in

$10.00 to $10.50 and Illinois flour from $8.00 to $8.50, at
Galena, whereas in the succeeding August they were $5.00

article of food that was quoted as cheaper at Galena than
at St. Louis was potatoes. They were $0.25 per bushel, at
Galena, and from $0.37-½ to $0.50 at St. Louis. Butter

Of the 13,635 persons who were following some occupation
in Illinois in 1820, nearly 91 per cent (12,395) were
engaged in agriculture.<a id="noteref_437" name="noteref_437" href="#note_437"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">437</span></span></a> To this pursuit the state was
naturally well adapted. One of the most observant of
German travelers in America wrote that the meaning of
<span class="tei tei-q">“fertile land”</span> was very different in this region from its
meaning in Germany. In America fertile land of the first
class required no fertilizer for the first century and was too
rich for wheat during the first decade, while fertile land of
the second class needed no fertilizer during the first twelve
to twenty years of its cultivation. Bottom-lands belonged
to the first class.<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href="#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a> The prairies remained unappreciated
by the Americans, although some foreign farmers preferred
to settle in Illinois, because there they could avoid having
to clear land, and could raise a crop the first year, while
coal could serve as fuel,<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href="#note_439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a> and a ditch and bank fence,
requiring little wood, could be constructed, or a hedge

largest prairies as not well adapted to cultivation, because
of the scarcity of wood, and in the fall of 1825 there was

It was easy to obtain land. After 1820 it could be
bought from the government of the United States at $1.25
per acre, it could be rented—sometimes for one peck of
corn per acre per year<a id="noteref_442" name="noteref_442" href="#note_442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a>—, or the claim of a squatter could
be purchased. When Peter Cartwright moved from Kentucky
to Illinois in 1824, he gave as reasons for moving
the fact that he had six children and but one hundred and
fifty acres of land, and that Kentucky land was high and
rising in value; the increase of a disposition in the South
to justify slavery; the distinction in Kentucky between
young people reared without working and those who
worked; the danger that his four daughters might marry
into slave families; and the need of preachers in the new
country.<a id="noteref_443" name="noteref_443" href="#note_443"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">443</span></span></a> The land being obtained, the first cultivation
was difficult. Writers often give the idea that after a year
or two the land which had been heavily timbered was left
free from trees, stumps, or roots, but many a pioneer
plowed for twenty years among the stumps. Stump fields
are today no novelty in Illinois, and farming has not retrograded.
Usually the settler's first need was a crop, and in
order to hasten its production the trees were girdled, a
process which might either precede or follow the planting,
according to the time of year in which the immigrant
arrived. If prairie land was plowed six horses, or their
equivalent of power in oxen, were required for the first
breaking, and a summer's fallow usually followed in order
to allow the roots to decay. In 1819 five dollars per acre
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was paid for the first plowing of the prairie, and three or
four dollars for the second.<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href="#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a>

Agricultural products exhibited considerable variety,
although corn was the chief article raised, because it
furnished food for man and beast, it gave a large yield,
and it was more easily harvested than wheat. Wheat was
raised without any great degree of care as to its culture,
being frequently sowed upon ground that was poorly prepared,
and being threshed in a most wasteful manner. Both
wheat and flour were exported. Flour-mills, often of a
rude sort, were found at inconveniently long distances
from each other. Ferdinand Ernst, traveling in 1819,
found a turbine wheel at the mill of Mr. Jarrott, a few
miles from St. Louis, and mentioned the fact as a peculiar
feature.<a id="noteref_445" name="noteref_445" href="#note_445"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445</span></span></a> Some of the settlers in Sangamon county had

mill in northern Illinois was erected on Fox River. It was
operated by the same power that ran a saw-mill, and the
millstones were boulders, laboriously dressed by hand.<a id="noteref_447" name="noteref_447" href="#note_447"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">447</span></span></a>
Tobacco of excellent quality was grown, and sometimes
formed an article of export.<a id="noteref_448" name="noteref_448" href="#note_448"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">448</span></span></a> Cotton was an important
article for home consumption. In the early years of the
state hopes were entertained that cotton might become an
article of export, but it was found that the crop required
so much labor as to make raising it in large quantities
unprofitable. It was after 1830, however, that it ceased
to be cultivated in the state. It was raised at least as far
north as the present Danville, about one hundred and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

parents moved to Sangamon county in 1819 says that
when in that county they raised, picked, spun, and wove
their own cotton. The children had to seed the cotton
before the fire in the long winter evenings. The importance
of cotton as a factor in inducing immigration may
have been considerable.<a id="noteref_450" name="noteref_450" href="#note_450"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">450</span></span></a> Large quantities of castor oil

It is not easy to exaggerate the simplicity of the farming
of pioneer times. When one reads that in 1817 a log
cabin of two rooms could be built for from $50.00 to
$70.00; a frame house, ten by fourteen feet, for $575.00 to
$665.00; a log kitchen for $31.00 to $35.50; a log stable
for $31.00 to $40.00; a barn for $80.00 to $97.75; a fence
for $0.25 per rod, and a prairie ditch for $0.29 to $0.44 per
rod; that a strong wagon cost $160.00; that a log house,
eighteen by sixteen feet, was made by contract for $20,
and ceiled and floored with sawn boards for $10 more;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that a cow and calf cost $12.00 to $16.00, and a breeding
sow, $2.00 or $3.00; that laborers received $0.75 per day
without board, and a man and two horses $1.00 per day;
and that various other useful articles could be procured at
certain prices, care is needed in order to avoid the conclusion
that an immigrant must have had several dollars, if
not a few hundreds of them. This need for care is increased
by the fact that the most detailed statistical data for early
Illinois is given by Birkbeck or his visitors, and is applicable
to the English settlement in Edwards county—a
settlement with enough unique features to make the data
almost more of an obstacle than a help. As a matter of
fact, many immigrants before 1820 had only enough money
to make the first payment on their land ($80.00), or after
July 1, 1820, only enough to buy the minimum tract
offered for sale ($100.00), while in both periods hundreds had
not even as much money as $80.00 or $100.00, and had to
become squatters. A log house, and practically all of the
first houses were of logs, was usually built without the
expenditure of one cent in cash, being erected by the
family which was to occupy it, or, if neighbors were within
reach, on the <span class="tei tei-q">“frolic”</span> system. Ceilings and floors were
both rare, and if a floor existed it was usually made of
puncheons. The number of pioneers who actually paid
as much as $31.00 for a log stable must have been small
indeed. First fences were often of brush, or brush and
logs, and many times crops were raised unfenced. Territorial
laws prohibited allowing stock to run at large during
the crop season. An immigrant often brought his cow and
sow, and if not he either did without, which in the latter
case was small privation in a region almost crowded with
game, or secured the desired animals by barter or by
working for a few days. Men frequently traded work, but
the payment of cash wages was rare, the cheapness of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
land and the ease of securing a living leaving small
inducement to anyone to become a day laborer;<a id="noteref_455" name="noteref_455" href="#note_455"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">455</span></span></a> while
for the same reason those who were professional laborers
were often of an undesirable type.<a id="noteref_456" name="noteref_456" href="#note_456"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456</span></span></a> Foreigners were sometimes
shocked at the utter carelessness of Illinois farmers.
A soil of great fertility, a region so abundantly supplied
with game and wild products as to make it almost possible
to live from the forest alone, combined with a lack of
efficient means of transportation, made such a temptation
to a life of idle ease as many pioneers did not resist. Be
it remembered, also, that although towns, retail trade,
and export trade had begun in Illinois by 1830, these
changes were not simultaneous throughout the state. As
1830 closed Illinois still had squatters many miles from a
mill, it still had Indians, it still had unbridged streams, it
still had regions far from a market—in a word, it had still
persisting in some part of its wide extent each of the ills
that had at various times confronted it in respect to
personal danger and lack of inducements to farmers. The
minority of really progressive farmers overcame the difficulties
confronting them by raising cattle or hogs and
driving them to distant markets, the price received being
almost clear profit, or by constructing their own boats and
shipping their produce.<a id="noteref_457" name="noteref_457" href="#note_457"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">457</span></span></a>

Although the great majority of the population of Illinois
was engaged in agriculture, there were salt works in the
southeast and lead mines in the northwest. The salt
industry was important. Far the greater part of the salt
made in the state was made at the Gallatin county saline,
near Shawneetown. In 1819 the indefinite statement was
made that these springs furnished between 200,000 and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
300,000 bushels of salt annually, the salt being sold at the
works at from fifty to seventy-five cents per bushel.<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href="#note_458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a> In
1822, the price of salt in Illinois was reported to have
fallen from $1.25 to $0.50, because of the discovery of
copious and strong salt wells.<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href="#note_459"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a> The next year a strong well was

of the Gallatin county saline stated that about
100,000 bushels of salt was made annually, and sold at
from $0.30 to $0.50 per bushel. The lessees paid $2,160.50
rent during the year.<a id="noteref_462" name="noteref_462" href="#note_462"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">462</span></span></a> In 1830, the salt works in Gallatin
county had a capital of $50,000; a product of from 100,000
to 130,000 bushels, selling at from $0.40 to $0.50; and three
hundred employees. The saline in Vermilion county had
a capital of $3500; a product of 3000 to 4000 bushels,
selling at $1.25 to $1.50 per bushel; and eight employees.
The works in Jackson county produced 3000 to 4000
bushels, selling at $0.75 to $1.00; and had from six to
eight employees. The difference in price is noteworthy as
indicating what must have been the difficulty of transporting
salt from Gallatin county to either Vermilion or Jackson
counties. At the Gallatin county works fuel was becoming
scarce and water had to be carried some distance in pipes,
thus increasing the cost of production. At the springs in
Indiana salt was $1.25 per bushel, and in Kentucky it was
$0.50 to $1.00. The states of New York, Virginia, Massachusetts
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

A pursuit that was once common and profitable is

Not until after 1830 was a common school system with
effective provision for its support established, although
subscription schools existed some years before the close of
the eighteenth century. Instruction given in the earliest
schools was slight, and in 1818 a most competent observer
declared that he believed that in Missouri <span class="tei tei-q">“at least one-third
of the schools were really a public nuisance, and did
the people more harm than good; another third about
balanced the account, by doing about as much harm as
good; and perhaps one-third were advantageous to the
community in various degrees. Not a few drunken, profane,
worthless Irishmen were perambulating the country,
and getting up schools; and yet they could neither speak,
read, pronounce, spell, or write the English language.”</span><a id="noteref_476" name="noteref_476" href="#note_476"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">476</span></span></a>
These schools closely resembled those of Illinois. Schoolbooks
were rare and children carried to school whatever

Religious societies were early organized, but the building
of churches was not then common. In 1796 a Baptist
society was organized, and previous to this time both
Baptists and Methodists, without organized societies, had
united in holding prayer-meetings in which the Bible
and published sermons were read, prayers offered, and
hymns sung.<a id="noteref_482" name="noteref_482" href="#note_482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">482</span></span></a> Before the close of the century the Methodists

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
combined ministerial duties with farming, hunting, or
some other frontier occupation. Neither class received
much money. Peter Cartwright, one of the most famous
pioneer preachers, received $40 one year (1824-25) and
$60 the next—and this he considered good wages.<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href="#note_485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">485</span></span></a>
Pioneer energy was displayed in the overcoming of
difficulties. For more than ten years the Baptists held
meetings on alternate months at two places thirty-six
miles apart, and several families regularly traveled that
distance to the two-days' meeting, even in unfavorable weather—and
this, too, after Illinois had become a state.<a id="noteref_486" name="noteref_486" href="#note_486"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">486</span></span></a>

the East or South reached Illinois, and at one time the
Baptists were divided into three factions, which had about
the same kind of fraternal relations as the Jews and the
Samaritans. The chief questions for contention were
whether or not missionaries should be sent out by the
church and whether fellowship with slaveholders should
be maintained.<a id="noteref_489" name="noteref_489" href="#note_489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a> An association of anti-slavery Baptists

the chief diversions for the pioneers.

Settlement.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Slavery, as well as indentured servitude, existed in
Illinois as late as 1845,<a id="noteref_491" name="noteref_491" href="#note_491"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">491</span></span></a> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Black Laws”</span> of the
state were repealed on February 7, 1865.<a id="noteref_492" name="noteref_492" href="#note_492"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">492</span></span></a> From 1787
until years after 1830 the slavery question was an unsettled
one. In addition to the arguments for or against the
institution that were used everywhere, the pro-slavery
party in Illinois asserted that as the Ordinance of 1787
guaranteed to the French inhabitants their property, the
French could hold slaves, and that as all citizens of a state
had equal rights other persons in Illinois could hold
slaves. The reply was that the Ordinance plainly forbade
slavery.<a id="noteref_493" name="noteref_493" href="#note_493"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">493</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whatever the merits of the argument, slavery did exist
in Illinois. The fear of the French that they might lose
their slaves, and the desire to attract slaveholders to
Illinois, led to determined and repeated efforts to legalize
slavery. Early in 1796 a petition was sent from Kaskaskia
to Congress, praying that the anti-slavery article in the
Ordinance of 1787 might be either repealed or so altered
as to permit the introduction of slaves from the original
states or elsewhere into the country of Illinois, that a law
might be enacted permitting the introduction of such
slaves as servants for life, and that it might be declared
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for what period the children of such servants should serve
the masters of their parents. This petition was signed by
four men, including some of the largest landowners in Illinois,
but as the petition, while purporting to come from
Illinois alone, concerned the entire Northwest Territory, as
there was no indication that the four petitioners represented
Illinois sentiment, and as the congressional committee was
informed that many of the inhabitants of the territory did
not desire the proposed change, the prayer of the petition
was denied.<a id="noteref_494" name="noteref_494" href="#note_494"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">494</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In 1800, two hundred and sixty-eight inhabitants of
Illinois, chiefly French, petitioned Congress to repeal the
anti-slavery provision of the Ordinance, stating that many
of the inhabitants were crossing the Mississippi with their
slaves. The petition was not considered.<a id="noteref_495" name="noteref_495" href="#note_495"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">495</span></span></a> A similar
request, presented late in 1802, was twice reported upon
by committees, one report (Randolph's) declaring that the
growth of Ohio proved that a lack of slavery would not
seriously retard settlement, while the other was in favor of
suspending the anti-slavery article for ten years, the male
descendants of immigrating slaves to be free at the age of
twenty-five years, and the females at twenty-one.<a id="noteref_496" name="noteref_496" href="#note_496"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">496</span></span></a> In
1805 a majority of the members of the respective houses
of the Indiana legislature petitioned for the repeal of the
anti-slavery article, and this petition was closely followed
by a memorial from Illinois expressing the hope that the
general government would not pass unnoticed the act of
the last legislature authorizing the importation of slaves
into the territory. It violated the Ordinance, the memorialists
declared, and although they desired slavery they
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
professed themselves to be law-abiding.<a id="noteref_497" name="noteref_497" href="#note_497"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">497</span></span></a> A committee
report on the petition and memorial recommended that
permission to import slaves into Indiana (then including
Illinois) for ten years be granted, in order that the evil
effects of slavery might be mitigated by its dispersion, but
no legislation resulted from the report,<a id="noteref_498" name="noteref_498" href="#note_498"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">498</span></span></a> and the next year
petitioning was resumed. The legislature sent resolutions
asking for the suspension of the anti-slavery article, and
elaborating the argument for such suspension. A committee
of which the territorial delegate from Indiana was
chairman, presented a favorable report.<a id="noteref_499" name="noteref_499" href="#note_499"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">499</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In September, 1807, a petition for the suspension of the
anti-slavery article was sent to Congress from the Indiana
legislature. It was signed by Jesse B. Thomas, later
author of the Missouri Compromise, but then Speaker of
the territorial House of Representatives, and resident in
what was to become the State of Indiana, and by the
president <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro tem.</span></span> of the Legislative Council. Action in
committee was adverse,<a id="noteref_500" name="noteref_500" href="#note_500"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">500</span></span></a> Congress being then busied with
the question of the abolition of the slave trade.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the territorial period in Illinois (1809-1818), the
slavery question was not much agitated. The Constitution
of 1818 provided that slaves could not be thereafter brought
into the State, except such as should be brought under
contract to labor at the Saline Creek salt works, said contract
to be limited to one year, although renewable, and
the proviso to be void after 1825, but existing slavery was
not abolished, and existing indentures—and some were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for ninety-nine years<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href="#note_501"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">501</span></span></a>—should be carried out. Male
children of slaves or indentured servants should be free at
the age of twenty-one and females at eighteen.<a id="noteref_502" name="noteref_502" href="#note_502"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">502</span></span></a> In Congress,
as has been seen, Tallmadge, of New York, objected
to admitting Illinois before she abolished slavery, but his
objection was ineffectual.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In March, 1819, a slave code was enacted. Any black
or mulatto coming into the State was required to file with
the clerk of a circuit court a certificate of freedom. Slaves
should not be brought into the state for the purpose of
emancipation. Resident negroes, other than slaves and
indentured servants, must file certificates of freedom.
Slaves were to be whipped instead of fined, thirty-nine
stripes being the maximum number that might be inflicted.
Contracts with slaves were void. Not more than two
slaves should meet together without written permission
from their masters. Any master emancipating his slaves
must give a bond of $1000 per head that such emancipated
slaves should not become public charges, failure to give
such a bond being punishable by a fine of $200 per head.
Colored people must present passes when traveling.<a id="noteref_503" name="noteref_503" href="#note_503"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">503</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Stringent as was the code of 1819, it was of a type
that was common in the slave states. Its passage may
have kept some negroes, both free and slave, from coming
into the state upon their own initiative without certificates
of freedom. From 1810 to 1820 the number of slaves in
Illinois increased from 168 to 917, Illinois being the only
state north of Mason and Dixon's line having an increase
in the number of slaves during the decade, although in
the Territory of Missouri, during this time, the number
increased from about 3000 to over 10,200. At the same
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
time the number of free blacks in Illinois decreased from
about 600 to some 450, while they increased in Indiana
from nearly 400 to over 1200. Of the slaves in Illinois in
1820 precisely 500 were in the counties of Gallatin and
Randolph, the former being the center of the salt-making
industry, and the latter the seat of the early French settlement
at Kaskaskia.<a id="noteref_504" name="noteref_504" href="#note_504"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">504</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whether the anti-slavery clause of the Ordinance of
1787 freed the slaves of the old French settlers was long a
disputed question, and it is certain that a strict construction
of the Illinois Constitution of 1818 made further
importation of slaves illegal. Many slave-owners passed
through southern Illinois to Missouri, because the main
road for emigration by land to that territory crossed the
Ohio River at Shawneetown. Many of the slaves who
produced the large increase in the number of slaves in
Missouri from 1810 to 1820 must have gone over this route.
In 1820 more than one-seventh of the population of
Missouri was slave.<a id="noteref_505" name="noteref_505" href="#note_505"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">505</span></span></a> The people of Illinois could not fail
to see that they were losing a certain class of emigrants—the
prosperous slaveholders. The loss became greater as
the likelihood of Missouri's admittance as a slave state
increased. As early as 1820 there was a rumor of the
formation of a party in Illinois to introduce slavery into
the state in a legal manner.<a id="noteref_506" name="noteref_506" href="#note_506"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">506</span></span></a> The next year an editorial
in a leading newspaper of Illinois said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Will the
admission of slavery in a new state tend to increase its
population?—is a question which has been of late much
discussed both within and without this state. It has been
contended that its admission would induce the emigration
of citizens of states as well where slavery was, as where it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was not tolerated—that while it would attract the attention
of the wealthy southern planter, it would not deter the
industrious northern farmer.”</span> The editor cites Ohio and
Kentucky as proof against the above argument. In 1810
Ohio had a population, in round numbers, of 230,700 and
Kentucky one of 406,500; in 1820 Ohio had 581,400, while
Kentucky had 563,300, giving a difference in favor of Ohio
of over 18,000; and an excess of gain during the decade,
in favor of Ohio, of 93,847. <span class="tei tei-q">“We are willing to take
into consideration the unsettled titles of land in the last-mentioned
state [Kentucky], and admit that in this respect
Ohio had a decided advantage—we will therefore deduct
the fraction of 93,847, believing it equivalent to the loss of
population from this cause—there is still a difference of
100,000.”</span><a id="noteref_507" name="noteref_507" href="#note_507"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">507</span></span></a> The editor's figures for 1810 were correct and
those for 1820 were approximately so. It is also true,
and in line with his argument, that during the same decade
Indiana showed an increase from 24,500 to 147,200, while
Missouri's increase was from 20,800 to 66,500; the
increase in Illinois being between the two in proportion of
increase—from 12,282 to 55,162.<a id="noteref_508" name="noteref_508" href="#note_508"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">508</span></span></a> The passing of the
slaveholders to Missouri continued and the discussion of
the slavery question became animated.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the gubernatorial election of 1822 there were four
candidates for governor, two being anti-slavery and two
pro-slavery in belief. Edward Coles, from Virginia, an
anti-slavery man, was elected by a plurality of but a few
votes. His election was due to a division in the ranks of
the opposite party, as is shown by the fact that the pro-slavery
party polled over 5300 votes, while the anti-slavery
party polled only some 3300.<a id="noteref_509" name="noteref_509" href="#note_509"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">509</span></span></a> In his message of December

This was referred to a select committee which reported as
follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“Your committee have carefully examined the
laws upon the subject, and with deep regret announce
their incapability of devising a more effectual plan than
the one already prescribed by law for the suppression of
such infamous crimes. It is believed that the benevolent

It is noteworthy that in this struggle the governor of
the state was an anti-slavery southerner; eleven of the
eighteen anti-slavery men in the legislature were southern;
the pro-slavery party, which polled 1971 more votes
than its opponents in 1822, was defeated by 1668 votes in
1824. It is also true that of the leaders in the campaign
some of the most noted were southern anti-slavery or
northern pro-slavery men.

The history of settlement suggests several explanations
for the votes of 1822 and 1824. The legislature which
passed the convention resolution had not been chosen
with the avowed purpose of doing so. Some designing
politicians had such an object in view and secured the
election of pro-slavery men by anti-slavery constituents.
The number of such cases was not large, but as the resolution
passed by the minimum vote they are important.<a id="noteref_520" name="noteref_520" href="#note_520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">520</span></span></a>
In 1822, however, there was almost without doubt a pro-slavery
majority in the state, but it is improbable that
there was a two-thirds majority. In the election of 1822,
there were 8635 votes cast, while in that of 1824 there were
11,612 votes cast. This great increase indicates a large
immigration. Immigration at this time was largely to
the northern counties of the state, and it is a point of
prime significance that each of the seven northern counties
gave large majorities against the calling of the convention,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and that without the vote of these seven counties the vote
would have been 4523 for a convention and 4408 against a
convention, thus changing the decision of the state. This
vote of the northern counties can not be explained by an
increased immigration from the north, because no such
increase to any significant degree is discoverable. The
admission of Missouri as a slave state would naturally
lead pro-slavery emigrants to go to that state instead of
to Illinois. Another event which tended to influence the
vote in Illinois was the decision of Indiana against slavery,
in the summer of 1823, in the midst of the campaign in
Illinois.<a id="noteref_521" name="noteref_521" href="#note_521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">521</span></span></a> The unjust action of the Illinois House of Representatives
in unseating an anti-convention member was
a powerful argument against the pro-slavery party.

In his message to the legislature, on November 16,

remnant of African slavery which still existed in this
state. The full discussion of the principles and policy of

resulting in its rejection by the decided voice of the
people, still more imperiously makes it my duty to call

kidnapping, which then prevailed to a great extent and

it necessary for the safety of the whites, that the laws for
their government, and concerning free blacks, should be
very strict.—But, there being no such motive here, the
necessity of such laws ceases, and consequently their
injustice and cruelty are the more apparent. The latter
are found every day more and more defective and inefficient;

The vote of 1824 against calling a constitutional convention

obstacle to the immigration of an anti-slavery population.
Slaveholders, never a large proportion of the immigrants,
practically ceased to come to the state, while the immigration
of anti-slavery southerners continued, and the

From 1820 to 1825 the increase of population in Illinois
was 17,655, while from 1825 to 1830 it was 84,628. Contemporaries
have left some interesting records of immigration
during the latter five years—a period in which the
population of the state increased more than 116 per cent.
Immigration had begun to be brisk by the fall of 1824.
At the general election in August, 1820, there were 1132
votes cast in Madison county, while at a similar election in

Pike, Fulton, Sangamon, Morgan and Greene counties. A

The character of the men who succeed in gaining the

No better type of the pioneer preacher need be sought
than the Rev. Dr. Peter Cartwright. He preached in the
West for nearly seventy years, during which time he delivered
some eighteen thousand sermons, baptized some
fifteen thousand persons, received into the church nearly
twelve thousand members, and licensed preachers enough
to make a whole conference. He was for fifty years a
presiding elder in the Methodist Episcopal church. His
home was in Illinois from 1824 until his death in 1872.
Aside from his ministerial duties he twice represented
Sangamon county in the Illinois House of Representatives;
was a candidate for congressman against Abraham
Lincoln in 1846; and was a member of an historical society
founded as early as 1827.

Cartwright had a number of traits that attracted frontiersmen.
In person he was about five feet ten inches
high, and of square build, having a powerful physical
frame and weighing nearly two hundred pounds. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
roughs and bruisers at camp-meetings and elsewhere stood
in awe of his brawny arm, and many anecdotes are told of
his courage and daring that sent terror to their ranks. He
felt that he was one of the Lord's breaking plows, and that he
had to drive his way through all kinds of roots and stubborn
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
soil.... His gesticulation, his manner of listening,
his walk, and his laugh were peculiar, and would command
attention in a crowd of a thousand. There was something
undefinable about the whole man that was attractive to
the majority of the people, and made them linger in his
presence and want to see him again.”</span> He had a remarkable
power to read men, his first impressions being quickly
made and almost always correct. He was often gay, but
never frivolous; often eccentric, but never silly. A Cumberland
Presbyterian, after attending a communion service
administered by Cartwright and at which the Baptist, Rev.
John M. Peck, was present, wrote: <span class="tei tei-q">“After meeting, I
invited these two men to spend the night with me, which
they did; and such a night!—of all Western anecdotes
and manners, flow of soul and out-spoken brotherhood—we
had never seen, and never expect to enjoy again.
These were, then [1824 c.], the two strongest men of mark
in the ministry, in this State [Illinois].”</span> Cartwright's
vitality was remarkable. In the sixty-sixth year of his
ministry, and the eighty-sixth of his life, he dedicated eight
churches, preached at seventy-seven funerals, addressed
eight schools, baptized twenty adults and fifty children,
married five couples, received fifteen into the church on
probation and twenty-five into full connection, raised
twenty-five dollars missionary money, donated twenty
dollars for new churches, wrote one hundred and twelve
letters, delivered many lectures, and sold two hundred
dollars worth of books. Many frontier preachers of the
time were lacking in common sense, but they were not
popular. This is the testimony of a contemporary (1828)

John Edgar, a native of Ireland, was one of the largest
landholders who ever lived in Illinois. At the outbreak
of the American Revolution he was a British officer living
at Detroit, but becoming implicated in the efforts of his
American wife to aid British soldiers in deserting, he was
imprisoned. He escaped, and in 1784 settled in Kaskaskia,
where his wife joined him two years later, having
saved from confiscation some twelve thousand dollars.
This made Edgar the rich man of the community. <span class="tei tei-q">“In
very early times, he erected, at great expense, a fine flouring
mill on the same site where M. Paget had built one sixty
years before. This mill was a great benefit to the public
and also profitable to the proprietor. Before the year
1800, this mill manufactured great quantities of flour for
the New Orleans market which would compare well with
the Atlantic flour.”</span> Edgar built a splendid mansion in
Kaskaskia and entertained royally. At a time when hospitality
was common he improved upon it. His home was
the fashionable resort for almost half a century. It was
here that Lafayette was entertained. In addition to his
flour mill, which attracted settlers to its vicinity near
Kaskaskia and which for many years did most of the
merchant business in flour in the country, Edgar owned
and operated salt works near the Mississippi, northwest of
Kaskaskia, and also invested largely in land. Before the
commissioners appointed to settle land claims he claimed
thirty-six thousand acres in one claim as the assignee of
ninety donation-rights, while he and John Murry St. Clair
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
claimed 13,986 acres which proved upon survey to cover
almost thirty thousand acres. In territorial times Edgar
paid more taxes than any one else in the territory. In
1790 Edgar was appointed chief justice of the Kaskaskia
district of St. Clair county; in 1800 he was <span class="tei tei-q">“Lieutenant-Colonel
Commandant of the First Regiment of Militia of
the County of Randolph”</span>; in 1802 he was commissioned
an associate judge of the Criminal Court of Randolph
county, by Governor Harrison. He had never studied
law <span class="tei tei-q">“but common sense, a good education, and experience
in business with perfect honesty made him a very respectable
officer.”</span> Edgar's correspondence with Clark and
Hamtramck show him to have been a leader in Illinois
during its period of anarchy preceding the establishment of
government in 1790. He offered to board a garrison on
the credit of the United States, if a garrison should be
sent to protect Illinois. At a time when slaveholding was
regarded as eminently respectable by the people of Illinois,
Edgar held slaves, and in 1796 he was one of four who
petitioned Congress to introduce slavery into the territory.
He was a member of the legislature of the Northwest
Territory, was worshipful master of the first Lodge of
Ancient Free and Accepted Masons in Illinois, constituted
at Kaskaskia in 1806, and was major-general of militia, in
which capacity he presided at reviews with much dignity.
In person Gen. Edgar was large and portly. He was
definitely charged with forgery by the commissioners to
settle land titles at Kaskaskia. In one case a letter signed
in a fair hand by one who had made his mark to a deed
was produced by Edgar. The letter was an offer of the
illiterate owner to sell his land to Edgar. There is no
indication that this conduct of the hospitable and popular
man changed the esteem in which he was held by his
contemporaries.<a id="noteref_547" name="noteref_547" href="#note_547"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">547</span></span></a>

successful. He was born in Wales in 1759, received
a collegiate education at Oxford, England, and afterward
took regular courses in both medicine and law. In 1783
he was a lawyer in London and owned property in Wales.
The next year he came to Philadelphia where he practiced
law and became acquainted with Benjamin Rush, Benjamin
Franklin, Myers Fisher, and other distinguished men. In
1786 he came to Kentucky and joined Clark's troops
against the Wabash Indians. A garrison was irregularly
established at Vincennes and Jones was made commissary-general.
He sold seized Spanish goods to partially indemnify
those whose goods had been seized by the Spanish.
In 1790 Jones removed to Kaskaskia, bringing to his
residence on the frontier a mind well trained by education
and experience. He early became a large landowner, in
1808 paying taxes on 16,400 acres in Monroe county alone.
The list of offices held by Jones shows him to have been
prominent wherever he went. He was attorney-general
of the Northwest Territory, a member and president of the
legislative council of the same, joint-revisor with John
Johnson, of the laws of Indiana Territory, one of the first
trustees, as well as a chief promoter, of Vincennes University,
official interpreter and translator of French for the
commissioners appointed to settle land claims at Kaskaskia,
and after his removal to Missouri, about 1810, a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
member of the Missouri Constitutional Convention of
1820, and, upon the admission of the state, justice of its
Supreme Court until his death in February, 1824. In
Missouri he engaged in lead mining and smelting with
Moses Austin and later with Austin's sons. He made an
exhaustive report on the lead mines of Missouri in 1816.
Jones was well versed in English, French and Spanish
law, especially in regard to land titles. He was an excellent
mathematician, and had also a thorough acquaintance with
the Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, English, and Welsh
languages. The pioneers recognized his peculiar fitness
for a legal career on the frontier. Governor Reynolds, a
fellow-townsman of Jones, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Judge Jones lived a
life of great activity and was conspicuous and prominent
in all the important transactions of the country ...
His integrity, honor, and honesty were always above doubt
or suspicion. He was exemplary in his moral habits, and
lived a temperate and orderly man in all things.”</span><a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href="#note_548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">548</span></span></a>

The founding of the towns of Mt. Carmel, Alton and
Springfield illustrates the work of successful town building
on the frontier. Mt. Carmel was laid out in 1817, Alton
in 1818, and the land where Springfield now stands was
entered in 1823.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The town of Mt. Carmel was founded by three ministers,
Thomas S. Hinde, William McDowell and William
Beauchamp, the first two being proprietors and the last
agent and surveyor. McDowell probably never settled in
Illinois. Hinde and Beauchamp were men of more than
ordinary ability. The former was a son of the well-known
Dr. Hinde, of Virginia, who was a surgeon in the
British navy during the French and Indian war. Dr.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Hinde moved to Kentucky and there the boy Thomas
grew up. At one time he was a neighbor of Daniel
Boone, and later of Simon Kenton. He was in the office
of the Superior Court of Kentucky for some time, during
which he became well acquainted with Governor Madison
and his nephew, John Madison, kinsmen of President James
Madison. He was well informed as to some of the obscure
movements of Aaron Burr. This led him to send copies
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fredonian</span></span>, which he published in order to oppose
Burr, to Henry Clay, then secretary of state, although the
copies later unaccountably disappeared; and, in 1829, to
write to James Madison, who was reported as contemplating
the writing of a political history, offering to furnish
information which he possessed at first hand concerning
the conspiracy. Madison denied any intention of writing
a history, but asked Hinde to furnish an account of Burr's
transactions to be filed with Madison's papers. This was
done. In 1806, Hinde moved to Ohio to get away from
slavery.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
William Beauchamp was born in Kent county, Delaware,
in 1772. He became a minister in the Methodist
Episcopal Church in 1794, but located in 1801 on account
of ill health. His ministry had been markedly successful
and he had been stationed in New York and Boston. In
1807 he settled on the Little Kanawha River in Virginia,
and in 1815 moved to Chillicothe, Ohio, where he acted as
editor of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Western Christian Monitor</span></span>, Hinde being a
contributor. Beauchamp knew Latin, Greek and Hebrew,
was a writer of considerable ability, and was well fitted to
be editor. In 1816, however, the General Conference
decided to establish a magazine, and in the following year
Beauchamp retired from the editorship of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Monitor</span></span>,
having successfully established the first Methodist magazine
in America. Beauchamp, Hinde and McDowell were now
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fellow-townsmen. They resolved to establish a town
where their ideas of rectitude might be applied.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The site chosen for the town was a point on the west
bank of the Wabash opposite the mouth of the White
River, and twenty-four miles southwest of Vincennes. This
point was selected because of the available water power
and of the likelihood that main roads from east to west
would pass here. The town became a railroad and manufacturing
center and justified the wisdom of its founders.
An elaborate circular, called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Articles of Association,
for the City of Mount Carmel,”</span> was issued at Chillicothe
in 1817. The purpose of the association was announced
to be <span class="tei tei-q">“to build a city on liberal and advantageous principles,
and to constitute funds for the establishment of
seminaries of learning and for religious purposes.”</span> The
proprietors reserved for themselves one-fourth of the lots,
these being called <span class="tei tei-q">“proprietors' lots;”</span> one-fourth were
called <span class="tei tei-q">“public donation lots;”</span> and one-half were called
<span class="tei tei-q">“private donation lots.”</span> The plan of survey and sale was
described as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“The front street is 132 feet wide;
the others 99. The in-lots are six poles in front, and
eleven and a half back; containing each sixty-eight
perches, nearly half an acre. The most of the out-lots
contain four acres and eight square poles; some of them
more, (five and six acres on the back range); and a few of
them less. There are 748 in-lots, and 331 out-lots—1079
in the whole.</span>

The plan for a town was successful. Beauchamp was
surveyor, pastor, teacher, and lawyer in the beginning of
settlement. By 1819 a school was established; four or
five years later a school-house was built; by 1820 Mt.
Carmel circuit of the M. E. church had been formed; in
1825 a brick church was erected; the same year the town
was incorporated by the state on the plan laid down in
the articles of association; in 1827 the annual conference
of the Illinois Conference was held at Mt. Carmel.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beauchamp's health having improved he reëntered the

Hinde, in 1825, was a member of the Wabash Navigation
Company, consisting of seventeen prominent Indiana
and Illinois men, and having a capital stock of one million
dollars. He was one of the nine directors for the first
year. He continued to be a contributor to periodical literature
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and became the biographer of his friend Beauchamp.
In a letter from Mt. Carmel, of May 6, 1842, Hinde says:
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have just returned from the East, having visited the
Atlantic cities generally for the first time, after forty-five
years pioneering in the wilderness of the West. I have
been three times a citizen of Kentucky, twice of Ohio, and
twice of Illinois.”</span> Hinde died in 1846 and was buried at
Mt. Carmel. Among his writings is found one of the
most acute analyses of frontier character that has appeared.
The writer points out that eastern ministers have often been
unsuccessful and eastern immigrants unpopular, because
they have underrated the people of the West, among
whom there are many people of culture. They prefer
<span class="tei tei-q">“the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">useful</span></em> to the shining or showy talent.”</span> In the West
the best work has been done by westerners. The English
spoken in the West is the purest to be found, because the
various provincialisms of the immigrants are mutually
corrective. The Virginian, who retained his unbounded
hospitality, was the most prominent character in the West.
<span class="tei tei-q">“If we expect to find on crossing the mountains a people
either illiterate or ignorant as a body, we will assuredly,
in many instances, be happily disappointed. It too often
happens, that one puffed up with self importance, and
possessing a conceited and heated imagination, will form
wild conjectures as to men and things. We have been
amused at the bewildered minds of such, with the <span class="tei tei-q">‘whys’</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">‘wherefores’</span>; and one of the most ridiculous whims of
some, is to endeavour to press every thing into their own
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mould</span></em>; and shape it, be it what it may, if possible, after
their own manner, custom, or operation, forgetting that
<span class="tei tei-q">‘we have to take the world as it is, and not as we would
have it to be.’</span> The fact is, an emigrant should come forth
as an inquirer, and set himself down to learn at the threshold
of experience. On this rock thousands have been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
injured, and none have suffered more than the English
emigrants. Oh! with what poignant grief have I heard
the English emigrant exclaim with the bitterest invectives
on his own course and conduct, as to this particular.
Conceiving that he knew every thing, when he came here
to test his experience, he soon found that he <span class="tei tei-q">‘knew
nothing.’</span> This circumstance I have found too to have its
bearings upon American emigrants from different states;
upon families, upon individuals, and upon preachers also.
How often have I heard the old settler complaining, (who
having himself learned by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">experience</span></em>) of the impertinent
conduct of an emigrant, who sometimes carries his local
policy through all the ramifications of his life, and often into
the religious society, as well as elsewhere; he wishing every
thing done, as he saw it done in Boston, New-York, Philadelphia,
Baltimore, and very often <span class="tei tei-q">‘Old England’</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Ireland!’</span> as if men who have to act, and reflect upon the
circumstances of the case, different from any ever before
presented except among themselves, are to be governed
by acts and doings of people in the moon!”</span><a id="noteref_549" name="noteref_549" href="#note_549"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">549</span></span></a> A man who

western town.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Rufus Easton was the founder of the town of Alton.
Like Hinde, he brought to his work a fund of experience
gained on the frontier and in public affairs. Easton was
born at Washington, Litchfield county, Connecticut, in 1774.
He descended from pioneers, being a direct descendant of
Joseph Easton, who came from England to Newtowne,
now Cambridge, Massachusetts, about 1633, and was later
one of Rev. Thos. Hooker's colony which founded Hartford,
Connecticut, of which Easton was an original proprietor.
In 1792 Rufus Easton's father, a Tory, obtained a
large grant of land near Wolford, now Easton Corners,
Ontario. Rufus received a good education before studying
law. In 1798 he was practicing law in Rome, New
York, then a frontier town. November, 1801, Easton, with
thirteen other prominent men, held a banquet to celebrate
the election of Thos. Jefferson as President. The prominence
of the young lawyer at this time is shown by the
fact that he was consulted in regard to federal appointments,
and that he was in 1803 a confidential correspondent
of De Witt Clinton. The winter of 1803-4 Easton spent
in Washington, where he became a friend of Aaron Burr,
Postmaster-General Granger, and others. In the spring
of 1804 he started for New Orleans. Aaron Burr gave
him a letter of introduction to Abm. R. Ellery, Esq., of
New Orleans, in which he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“You will certainly be
greatly amused to converse with a man who has passed
the whole winter in this city—who has had free intercourse
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the officers of Govt. &amp; members of Congress—who
has discernment to see beyond the surface, and frankness
and independence enough to speak his own sentiments.”</span>
Easton did not, however, go to New Orleans. He stopped
for a short time at Vincennes and then located at St. Louis.
He was appointed by Jefferson judge of the Territory of
Louisiana and first postmaster of St. Louis. In September,
1805, Burr, Wilkinson and Easton had a conference at
St. Louis. Easton turned a deaf ear to Burr's questionable
proposals and from this time Wilkinson was hostile to
Easton. Easton corresponded with Jefferson and Granger
concerning the Burr conspiracy. Jefferson appointed him
United States attorney, 1814-18 he was delegate to Congress
from Missouri, 1821-26 he was attorney-general of
Missouri. Easton was very prominent, entertaining almost
all visitors of note. Edward Bates, Lincoln's attorney-general,
read law in Easton's office.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Soon after coming to St. Louis, Easton began to buy up
claims to land in Missouri and Illinois. When seeking to
find a suitable place for a town in Illinois, he selected a
point on the east bank of the Mississippi, twenty-five
miles north of St. Louis and twenty miles south of the
mouth of the Illinois. There was here a good landing
place for boats, and also extensive beds of coal and limestone.
The town was named Alton in honor of the
founder's son. One hundred lots in the new town were
donated to the support of the gospel and public schools,
one-half of the proceeds to be devoted to each. This
provision was confirmed by the act of incorporation of
January 30, 1821, and the trustees were given the right to
tax undonated lots for the support of schools. This latter
provision was in advance of public sentiment and two
years later it was repealed. Alton, like Mt. Carmel and to
a much greater extent, proved the wisdom of its location.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It has long been noted for its manufactures and is a
thriving modern city.<a id="noteref_550" name="noteref_550" href="#note_550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">550</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The town of Springfield, since 1839 the capital of
Illinois, was laid out in 1822, before the land upon which
it stood was offered for sale. When the land was sold in
November, 1823, the section upon which the town stood
was bought by Elijah Iles, Pascal Paoli Enos, Thomas
Cox, and Daniel P. Cook, each purchasing one quarter,
but the title being vested by agreement in Iles and Enos.
Cook, like McDowell in the founding of Mt. Carmel,
seems to have been a non-resident proprietor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Elijah Iles was a child of the wilderness. He was born
in Kentucky in 1796, and died at Springfield, Illinois, in
1883, leaving valuable reminiscences of his long experience
on the frontier. His mother was Elizabeth Crockett Iles,
a relative of David Crockett. Elijah attended school two
winters and taught two winters. In 1812, although but
sixteen years of age, he acted as deputy for his father, who
was sheriff of Bath county, Kentucky. Some three years
later his father gave him three hundred dollars, with which
he bought one hundred head of yearling cattle. For three
years he herded these cattle among the mountains of Kentucky,
about twenty miles from civilization, having as his
only companions his horse, dog, gun, milk cow, and the
cattle. His meals usually consisted of a stew made of
bear meat, venison, or turkey, and a piece of fat bacon.
At the end of the three years the cattle were sold for
about ten dollars a head, and the youthful dealer having
attained his majority went to Missouri and became a land
agent for eastern speculators, and soon began to speculate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for himself. In 1821, concluding that Missouri was too
far from a market, he sold some of his land and resolved to
move to Illinois. At that time the site upon which Springfield
was to stand had been chosen as the temporary
county seat of Sangamon county, because eight men, some
of whom had families, lived within a radius of two miles
from the site, and at no other place in the county could
the lawyers and judge secure board and lodging. Iles
quickly discerned the advantages of the Sangamon country
as a place of settlement, and straightway built a log store
sixteen feet square, went to St. Louis and bought fifteen
hundred dollars worth of goods, which he loaded on a
keel-boat and had towed up the Mississippi and the
Illinois by six men, whom he paid seventy-five dollars
for their services. When the land was offered for sale, in
1823, Iles bought a quarter-section.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another quarter-section of the town site was bought by
Pascal Paoli Enos. The fact that the frontier is a great
social leveler is well illustrated by the combination of
Enos and Iles as joint owners of a town site. The Enos
family had come from England in 1648, and Pascal Paoli
Enos, son of Major-General Roger Enos, was born in
Windsor, Connecticut, in 1770. He was graduated from
Dartmouth College in 1794, studied law, was a member of
the Vermont legislature in 1804, married in Vermont and
moved to Cincinnati in 1815, later to St. Charles, Missouri,
then to St. Louis, then to Madison county, Illinois, and in
1823 was appointed by President Monroe receiver of
public moneys for the land-office in the District of Sangamo.
Thus the elderly scholar joined the shrewd but
youthful frontiersman.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Col. Thomas Cox was the third of the trio of the resident
proprietors of Springfield. He had signed a petition
for the division of Randolph county in 1812, represented
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Union county as a senator in the first general assembly of
Illinois, and in 1820 was appointed register of the land-office
at Vandalia. In 1823 he came to Springfield as
register of the land-office at that place. Col. Cox was six
feet tall, weighed two hundred and forty pounds, and was
a drunkard within a short time after the founding of
Springfield.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The most important thing about the founding of the
town is the heterogeneous character of its founders. A
few incidents in their subsequent history will emphasize
this, and also show how well they worked together when
surrounded by the same conditions. When the commissioners
came to locate a permanent county seat Springfield,
then called Calhoun, had a formidable rival for the
honor. Iles and Enos managed to have a mutual friend
engaged as guide to the commissioners. The guide conducted
them to the rival settlement by a long and rough
route and upon being requested to take them back over a
shorter route he took a course more difficult still. The
commissioners decided that the rival settlement was inaccessible.
Iles was twice state senator, major in the Winnebago
war, and captain in the Black Hawk war, in which
he served with Zachary Taylor, Jefferson Davis, Abraham
Lincoln, John T. Stuart, Robt. Anderson, of Fort Sumter
fame, and others. Iles was also a large stock dealer, selling
hogs and cattle in St. Louis and mules in Kentucky, until
1838, in which year he lost ten thousand dollars on hogs
packed at Alton. In 1838-9 he built the American House
in Springfield. This was then the largest hotel in the
state and its erection created a great sensation. He was
four times state senator, and was an officer of the Bank of

removed for political reasons by Jackson in 1829. Cox
had an eventful career. He was removed from his position

of register, under charges of misconduct, early in 1827;
the next year he was keeping a hotel in Springfield; later
he removed to Iowa, then Wisconsin, having secured a
contract for the survey of public lands. He was three
times a member of the Iowa territorial House of Representatives
and twice a member of the territorial Council.
A band of murderers, horsethieves, counterfeiters, and
blacklegs, having gained possession of the town of Bellevue,
on the Mississippi, in Jackson county, Iowa, Col. Cox
led the citizens in a successful attack in which seven men
were killed outright and some ten or fifteen wounded. At
this time Cox was recognized as a pronounced drunkard,
but his undoubted courage, ability to command, and strong
physique secured him a following.<a id="noteref_551" name="noteref_551" href="#note_551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">551</span></span></a>

Shadrach Bond, the first governor of Illinois, and Pierre
Menard, the first lieutenant-governor, were both poorly
educated, but they had a good knowledge of men and a
large fund of information concerning practical affairs.<a id="noteref_552" name="noteref_552" href="#note_552"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a>
Edward Coles, the second governor of the state, is a good
example of the polished, well-educated gentleman succeeding
with a rude constituency. Coles was born in 1786,
in Albemarle county, Virginia, fitted for college by private
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tutors, educated at Hampden Sidney and later at William
and Mary College. His father's home was visited by
Patrick Henry, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, the Randolphs,
Tazwell, Wirt, and others. For six years Coles
was the private secretary of President Madison, and during
this time he became an intimate friend of Nicholas Biddle.
In 1815 he visited Illinois in what must have seemed at
that time great state, for he traveled not only with a horse
and buggy, but with a servant and a saddle-horse as well.
In 1816-17 he was sent as a special messenger to Russia,
stopping at Paris on his return, meeting Louis XVIII. of
France and becoming a friend of Lafayette. In 1819 he
came to Edwardsville, Illinois, emancipated his slaves, and
assumed his duties as register of the land-office. The
rough pioneers were very anxious to get a title to their
lands. <span class="tei tei-q">“When the settler reached Edwardsville, dressed
in jeans and wearing moccasins, with his money in his
belt, having traveled on foot or on horseback long distances,
and first presented himself to the Register of the
Land Office, there he found Edward Coles, who had
recently emigrated into the State from Virginia. It was
known to some of them that he had been the private secretary
for President Madison, and had been on an important
mission to Europe.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“They found him a young man of handsome, but somewhat
awkward personal appearance, genteelly dressed, and
of kind and agreeable manners. The anxious settler was
at once put at ease by the suavity of his address, the
interest he appeared to feel in aiding him, and the thoroughly
intelligent manner in which he discharged his
duty. No man went away who was not delighted with
his intercourse with the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Register.’</span> And herein is illustrated
the great mistake so often made by politicians and
candidates for popular favor. Too many candidates for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the suffrage of the people in our early political contests
thought it necessary, in order to make themselves popular,
to affect slovenly and unclean dress and vulgar
manners in their campaigns. There was never a greater
mistake. However rough, ill-clothed and unintelligent
the voter might be, he always preferred to vote for the
man who was dressed and acted like a gentleman to the
one who dressed like and acted like himself.”</span><a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href="#note_553"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">553</span></span></a> Coles
was always dignified, always gentlemanly, and always
respected. His brief residence in Illinois affected its
history for all time to come. Like Coles in several
respects was his successor as governor, Ninian Edwards.
Born in Maryland in 1775, educated by the celebrated
William Wirt, and later graduating from Dickinson College,
Pennsylvania, at nineteen years of age he came to Kentucky.
Here he served two terms in the Kentucky
legislature, was presiding judge of the general court,
circuit judge, and chief-justice of the court of appeals.
Henry Clay gave as Edwards' marked characteristics,
good understanding, weight of character, and conciliatory
manners. In his campaign for governor of Illinois,
Edwards presented himself as the highest type of a polished
and well-dressed gentleman, always riding in his
own carriage and driven by his negro servant, and dressing
in all the style of an old-fashioned gentleman with broad-cloth
coat, ruffled shirt, and high-topped boots. The
people were not repelled by such a display, but considered
it an honor to vote for such a man. The egotistical
Adolphus Frederick Hubbard, who was one of the two
opponents of Edwards, intermingled bad grammar and
poor attempts at wit in his electioneering speeches, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
received less than one-tenth of the number of votes cast
for either of the two other candidates.<a id="noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href="#note_554"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">554</span></span></a>

Charles M. Eames, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Historic
Morgan and Classic Jacksonville</span></span> (1885),
says that a vigilance committee with the above title was formed in 1821, or
thereabouts, to rid the country of horse-thieves and robbers. <span class="tei tei-q">“A regular
constitution was drawn up and subscribed to, and this paper is still in existence.”</span>
C. M. Eames, son of the now deceased author, in a letter of Oct. 7,
1903, said that he had made an unsuccessful search for the manuscript.

Erroneous statements concerning the time of the formation of the County of
Illinois have been made by Winsor, <span class="tei tei-q">“Westward Movement,”</span> 122; Poole, in

ed., 64; and others. Roosevelt's indefinite statement that the county was
formed <span class="tei tei-q">“in the fall of 1778”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Winning of the West,”</span> II., 168—is
technically correct. Kate Mason Rowland truthfully says—<span class="tei tei-q">“George Mason,”</span>
I., 307, 308—that
a committee was ordered to prepare a bill for the formation of the county,
on November 19, 1778, and that such a bill was presented on November 30.
Butterfield says—<span class="tei tei-q">“George Rogers Clark's Conquest of the Ill.,”</span> 681-6—that
the Act was passed between the 10th of November and the 12th of December,
1778. It is true that the bill in its final amended form passed both houses on
December 9, was signed by the Speaker of the Senate on December 17, and
subsequently, if at all, by the Speaker of the House of Delegates. On the
12th of December, Governor Patrick Henry issued three important sets of
instructions in accordance with the provisions of the Act creating the County
of Illinois. As the signing of the bill by the Speakers was mandatory after
its passage, it is easy to understand the issuance of these instructions previous
to the signing. It is almost impossible to conceive that Governor Henry, who
showed marked interest in the Western frontier, should first have begun to
issue orders at least six weeks after the county was formed, as is implied by
the date commonly given for its formation. For the legislative history of the
act, see <span class="tei tei-q">“Jour. H. of Del.,”</span> Va., Oct. Sess., 1778, 65, 72, 79-80, 91, 96, 106-7;

Col. John Todd, jr., was born March 27, 1750, in Pennsylvania. He was
well educated by his uncle in Virginia, in which state young Todd practised
law for some years. In 1775, he was one of the representatives chosen at the
call of the proprietors of Transylvania to form an ultra-constitutional government
for that new settlement. In 1777, he was one of the first two
burgesses from the county of Kentucky. He was killed at the Battle of the

I have been unable to determine just when Col. Todd left Illinois, whether
he resigned as county-lieutenant, and whether he again returned. Boyd in
his article in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Am. Hist. Rev.,”</span> IV., says that he left in 1780, resigned
in the same year, and apparently did not return. Mason, in <span class="tei tei-q">“Chicago Hist.
Soc. Coll.,”</span> IV., 287, says that he seems to have left in 1779, seems not to
have resigned, and not to have returned. Wickliffe, in Morehead, <span class="tei tei-q">“Settlement
of Ky.,”</span> 174, implies that he did not resign, and says that he several
times revisited the county. No one of these writers gives any authority for
his statement and I have found none. It is certain that Todd was at the
Falls of Ohio on December 23, 1779; that he then wrote to the governor of
Virginia expressing his intention of resigning; that the governor, Jefferson,
strongly opposed his resigning—<span class="tei tei-q">“Chicago Hist. Soc. Coll.,”</span> IV., 359; that
he left some peltry in the joint care of his subordinates, Montgomery and
Winston, in November, 1779; that goods were said to be consigned to him as
county-lieutenant of Illinois in November, 1780; that he wrote <span class="tei tei-q">“I still receive
complaints from the Illinois,”</span> on April 15, 1781; that on April 29, 1781,
Winston was referred to as <span class="tei tei-q">“Deputy County-Lieutenant for the Illinois
County;”</span> and that Thimothé Demunbrunt signed as <span class="tei tei-q">“Lt. Comd. par interim,

France should regain her hold in America was desired by many Frenchmen,
but on the other hand, the French government was pledged by its treaty of
alliance to make no acquisitions of territory in America. The following

The offenders being tributary to the Six

sufferers, on November 3, 1768, at Fort Stanwix, the tract of some two million
five hundred thousand acres, later known as the claim of the Indiana
Company. The land lay southeast of the Ohio, and was claimed in part by
both Virginia and Pennsylvania. For map see <span class="tei tei-q">“States of America,”</span> by J.

He makes a ditch 4 ft. wide at top, sloping
to 1 ft. wide at bottom, and 4 ft. deep. With the earth that comes out of the
ditch he makes a bank on one side, which is turfed towards the ditch. Then
a long pole is put up from the bottom of the ditch to 2 ft. above the bank; this
is crossed by a short pole from the other side, and then a rail is laid along
between the forks. The banks were growing beautifully, and looked altogether
very neat as well as formidable, though a live hedge (which he intends
to have) instead of dead poles and rails, upon top, would make the fence far
more effectual as well as handsomer.”</span>—Hulme, in Cobbett, <span class="tei tei-q">“Year's Residence

The vote as here given is from Moses, <span class="tei tei-q">“Illinois,”</span> I., 324. It is also given in
Harris, <span class="tei tei-q">“Negro Servitude in Illinois,”</span> 48. It differs to a slight degree from
that given by William H. Brown in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Historical Sketch of the Early
Movement in Illinois for the Legalization of Slavery,”</span> read at the annual
meeting of the Chicago Hist. Soc., Dec. 5, 1864 (<span class="tei tei-q">“Fergus Hist. Ser.,”</span> No. 4),
and in Washburne, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sketch of Edward Coles,”</span> 191. Brown was one of the
leaders in the struggle and his work is of especial value. It is probable that
the vote appended to his address was prepared by some one else. The work
of Moses is of later date and his figures correspond to the official report in
respect to the majority against the convention, as the others do not.</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_520" name="note_520" href="#noteref_520">520.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Brown,

recall the difficulty which was experienced by the men who governed the
Northwest Territory under the Ordinance of 1787 when they attempted to
use only such laws as had been adopted by some state. The attempt was
early and finally abandoned. Hinde gives the following in a foot-note: <span class="tei tei-q">“A
gentleman, a Virginian, a physician of eminence who was educated in Paris,
visited a western state many years ago [written in 1827], and lost all his money
by gambling, (playing at cards). Meeting a friend on the mountains on his
return, he was thus addressed: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Well, doctor, you have been to see the new
country.’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘Yes,’</span> replied the doctor, biting his lips, <span class="tei tei-q">‘it is a new country, it
is true; but there are some of the oldest people in it that I ever saw.’</span> ”</span>—See

            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
